# Comprehensive Plan for Autoresearch Code Completion

Based on a thorough analysis of the Autoresearch codebase, I've developed a comprehensive plan to bring the project to completion. This plan addresses all aspects of the system, from core functionality to testing and documentation.

## Status

As of **August 18, 2025**, Autoresearch targets an **0.1.0-alpha.1**
preview on **2026-03-01** and a final **0.1.0** release on
**July 1, 2026**. `uv run flake8 src tests` passes, yet `uv run mypy src`
fails with `Error importing plugin "pydantic.mypy": No module named
'pydantic'`, and `uv run pytest -q` stops with 30 collection errors
including missing `pytest_bdd`, so integration and behavior suites remain
failing. Outstanding issues include these checks
([resolve-current-test-failures](issues/resolve-current-test-failures.md)).
