# Comprehensive Plan for Autoresearch Code Completion

Based on a thorough analysis of the Autoresearch codebase, I've developed a
comprehensive plan to bring the project to completion. This plan addresses all
aspects of the system, from core functionality to testing and documentation.

## Status

As of **October 6, 2025 at 14:38 UTC** the refreshed `uv run task check` sweep
reaches flake8 and mypy cleanly before `check_spec_tests.py` halts on the
long-standing documentation/test mapping backlog; lint fallout is resolved and
spec coverage remapping is now the gate to a green run.
【F:baseline/logs/task-check-20251006T143809Z.log†L1-L160】 The prior
**04:41 UTC** `uv run task verify` log still captures `flake8` failures across
search, cache, and AUTO-mode telemetry modules, so the verify gate remains
closed until those files receive the same hygiene pass.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251006T044116Z.log†L1-L124】 The paired
`uv run task coverage` sweep begins compiling GPU-heavy extras
(`hdbscan==0.8.40` is the first build) and was aborted to preserve the
evaluation window, so coverage remains pegged to the earlier 92.4 % evidence
until the lint cleanup lands.【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251006T044136Z.log†L1-L8】
The updated preflight plan records PR-S1, PR-S2, and PR-R0 as merged while
promoting lint repair, coverage reruns, and TestPyPI reactivation as the next
gates, and the alpha ticket mirrors the same checklist.
【F:docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md†L1-L210】【F:issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md†L1-L64】

### Immediate Follow-ups

- [x] Ship **PR-S1** – deterministic search stubs, hybrid ranking signatures,
  and refreshed fixtures are merged, keeping canonical queries consistent
  across telemetry and cache layers.【F:src/autoresearch/search/core.py†L650-L686】
  【F:src/autoresearch/search/core.py†L1431-L1468】【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L503-L608】
- [x] Ship **PR-S2** – namespace-aware cache keys and property fixtures now
  prevent redundant backend calls across namespaces and storage hints.
  【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L503-L608】【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L779-L879】
  【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L883-L1010】
- [x] Ship **PR-R0** – AUTO mode claim hydration leverages the reasoning
  payload normalisers and orchestrator merge logic to keep telemetry
  serialisable.【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/reasoning_payloads.py†L1-L166】
  【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/parallel.py†L191-L210】
- [ ] Deliver **PR-O1** – finish output formatter fidelity work so control
  characters and whitespace remain intact across JSON and markdown outputs.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-R1** – confirm warning banners stay in structured telemetry
  while answers remain clean in CLI and API flows.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-P1** – recalibrate scheduler benchmarks with merged claim
  hydration and deterministic cache behaviour.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-L0** – restore test module hygiene by removing duplicated
  imports, ensuring each file keeps `from __future__ import annotations` at the
  top, and capturing a green `uv run task check` log for the release dossier.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-L1** – reintroduce the legacy helper scripts under
  `tests/scripts/` (or rewire imports to the production copies), regenerate the
  scheduler benchmark fixture from current baselines, and document provenance in
  `baseline/` so pytest collection can progress.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-V1** – once lint and collection succeed, capture fresh
  `task verify` and `task coverage` logs without GPU extras, restoring the
  release evidence trail ahead of the tag proposal.
- [ ] Repair lint fallout from PR-S1/S2/R0 so `uv run task verify` reaches
  mypy and pytest, then rerun coverage without GPU extras unless explicitly
  required and publish the new logs through the release dossier.
- [ ] Resume TestPyPI dry runs once verify and coverage are green, then close
  the remaining [prepare-first-alpha-release](issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
  milestones before proposing the tag.【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251006T044116Z.log†L1-L124】

## Deep Research Enhancement Program

The dialectical review of September 26, 2025 adds five tracked initiatives to
reach the truthfulness, auditability, and UX targets described in the project
proposal. Each initiative links to the dedicated ticket so progress is visible
alongside the alpha release workstream.

1. **Adaptive gate and claim audits** – Gate policy, scout signals, and
   per-claim audit tables tracked in
   [adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout](issues/archive/adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout.md).
2. **Planner and coordinator ReAct upgrade** – Structured task graphs, tool
   affinity routing, and telemetry enhancements tracked in
   [planner-coordinator-react-upgrade](issues/planner-coordinator-react-upgrade.md).
3. **Session GraphRAG integration** – Session knowledge graph construction,
   contradiction checks, and artifact exports tracked in
   [session-graph-rag-integration](issues/session-graph-rag-integration.md).
4. **Evaluation and layered UX expansion** – TruthfulQA/FEVER/HotpotQA harness
   automation, layered outputs, and Socratic controls tracked in
   [evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion](issues/evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion.md).
5. **Cost-aware model routing** – Role-based model selection, budgets, and
   telemetry tracked in
   [cost-aware-model-routing](issues/cost-aware-model-routing.md).
