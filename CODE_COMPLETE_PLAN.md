# Comprehensive Plan for Autoresearch Code Completion

Based on a thorough analysis of the Autoresearch codebase, I've developed a
comprehensive plan to bring the project to completion. This plan addresses all
aspects of the system, from core functionality to testing and documentation.

## Status

As of **October 4, 2025 at 05:34 UTC** the strict typing gate remains green:
`uv run mypy --strict src tests` reports “Success: no issues found in 790
source files”, so we can focus on clearing the remaining pytest regressions
before rerunning the full release sweep.【c2f747†L1-L2】 A fresh
`uv run --extra test pytest` sample at **05:31 UTC** fails immediately in the
search stub suite: both the legacy and VSS-enabled paths miss the expected
`add_calls` telemetry and the fallback bundle preserves the templated query,
confirming PR-C must repair backend instrumentation first.
【81b49d†L25-L155】【81b49d†L156-L204】 The broader release sweep still stalls
earlier in the dialectical pipeline. The
`uv run task verify EXTRAS="nlp ui vss git distributed analysis llm parsers"`
attempt fails in flake8, which reports unused imports, excess blank lines, and
trailing whitespace across Search, behavior, integration, and storage suites.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251004T015651Z.log†L1-L62】 Minutes later
`uv run task coverage EXTRAS="nlp ui vss git distributed analysis llm
parsers"` stops when the legacy branch of
`tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend` no
longer records the expected instance `add_calls`, keeping coverage frozen at
the prior 92.4 % baseline.【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251004T015738Z.log†L1-L565】
The preflight plan still sequences remediation through PR-A to PR-H, and the
alpha issue plus task log now point to the new evidence while TestPyPI stays
paused pending lint and search instrumentation fixes.
【F:docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md†L9-L323】
【F:issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md†L1-L32】

### Immediate Follow-ups

- [ ] Ship **PR-A** – normalize FactChecker defaults and update
  reverification fixtures so the reverification unit test suite passes
  while preserving opt-out coverage.
- [ ] Ship **PR-B** – repair backup scheduler restart semantics and rotation
  policy to satisfy `tests/unit/storage/test_backup_scheduler.py` without
  introducing timing flakiness.
- [ ] Ship **PR-C** – restore search cache determinism and stub behaviour so
  cache-related unit tests stop over-fetching and preserve query text.
- [ ] Ship **PR-D** – expose `autoresearch.api.parse`, align FastMCP adapter
  construction, and unblock the API and MCP handshake suites.
- [ ] Ship **PR-E** – normalise orchestrator error claim payloads and
  parallel timeout messaging so error-handling suites regain mapping-based
  claims.
- [ ] Ship **PR-F** – stabilise storage initialisation and migration
  contracts to satisfy incremental update and DuckDB migration tests.
- [ ] Ship **PR-G** – provide planner metadata adapters and refreshed
  docstrings so planner metadata and documentation hygiene suites pass.
- [ ] Ship **PR-H** – supply environment metadata fixtures and telemetry
  guards for the `check_env_warnings` and `formattemplate_metrics` tests.
- [ ] Ship **PR-I** – rerun `task coverage` after PR-A through PR-H land and
  update release documentation with the new evidence.
- [ ] Ship **PR-J** – add AUTO mode telemetry once the suite is green.
- [ ] Ship **PR-K** – layer dependency-aware planner prompts with Socratic
  self-checks building on PR-J outputs.
- [ ] Complete the
  [prepare-first-alpha-release](issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
  milestones with the refreshed coverage data and updated documentation set.

## Deep Research Enhancement Program

The dialectical review of September 26, 2025 adds five tracked initiatives to
reach the truthfulness, auditability, and UX targets described in the project
proposal. Each initiative links to the dedicated ticket so progress is visible
alongside the alpha release workstream.

1. **Adaptive gate and claim audits** – Gate policy, scout signals, and
   per-claim audit tables tracked in
   [adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout](issues/archive/adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout.md).
2. **Planner and coordinator ReAct upgrade** – Structured task graphs, tool
   affinity routing, and telemetry enhancements tracked in
   [planner-coordinator-react-upgrade](issues/planner-coordinator-react-upgrade.md).
3. **Session GraphRAG integration** – Session knowledge graph construction,
   contradiction checks, and artifact exports tracked in
   [session-graph-rag-integration](issues/session-graph-rag-integration.md).
4. **Evaluation and layered UX expansion** – TruthfulQA/FEVER/HotpotQA harness
   automation, layered outputs, and Socratic controls tracked in
   [evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion](issues/evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion.md).
5. **Cost-aware model routing** – Role-based model selection, budgets, and
   telemetry tracked in
   [cost-aware-model-routing](issues/cost-aware-model-routing.md).
