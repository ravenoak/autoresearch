# Comprehensive Plan for Autoresearch Code Completion

Based on a thorough analysis of the Autoresearch codebase, I've developed a
comprehensive plan to bring the project to completion. This plan addresses all
aspects of the system, from core functionality to testing and documentation.

## Status

As of **October 7, 2025 at 16:42 UTC** the strict typing gate remains green:
`uv run mypy --strict src tests` reports “Success: no issues found in 797 source
files.”【0aff6f†L1-L1】 This confirms PR-L0a held after the latest refactors and
allows us to focus on test hygiene and coverage work without reopening the
typing backlog.

The same window’s full-suite pytest sweep (`uv run --extra test pytest -q`)
still halts during collection: six modules raise
`SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file`
because duplicated standard-library imports precede
`from __future__ import annotations`.【2fa019†L1-L65】 These errors align with the
lint fallout captured in the verify logs and keep the suite from exercising the
known cache determinism regression. We must ship a short lint-and-hygiene PR
before behaviour or coverage evidence can move forward.

Earlier, at **16:29 UTC**, the strict gate briefly regressed when AUTO-mode
claim hydration stored non-string answers without freezing them and tests relied
on unused ignores.【1fc7a3†L1-L5】 `_snapshot_scout_sample` now freezes
non-string answers while the AUTO mode tests cast telemetry to
`FrozenReasoningStep` tuples so strict mode recognises the immutability
assertions ahead of the refreshed sweep.【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/orchestrator.py†L108-L134】
【F:tests/unit/orchestration/test_auto_mode.py†L1-L191】 A follow-up strict run at
**16:34 UTC** succeeds while the targeted AUTO mode regression suite now passes,
providing evidence for PR-L0a completion before we resume cache determinism
work.【27806b†L1-L1】【7b397e†L1-L9】

As of **October 7, 2025 at 05:48 UTC** `uv run mypy --strict src tests` still
reports “Success: no issues found in 797 source files,” confirming the strict
gate remains green after the latest orchestration and cache refactors.
【6bfb2b†L1-L1】 A targeted
`uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit/legacy/test_relevance_ranking.py -k
external_lookup_uses_cache` run during the same window continues to fail with
`backend.call_count == 3`, keeping cache determinism as the highest-impact
regression blocking a green suite before verify and coverage can resume.
【7821ab†L1031-L1034】

Earlier at **04:38 UTC** `uv run task check` cleared `flake8` and the strict
sweep before `check_spec_tests.py` flagged missing specification anchors,
leaving spec/test drift as the quick-gate blocker until the regenerated
includes landed.【F:baseline/logs/task-check-20251007T0438Z.log†L1-L165】 The
follow-up **05:09 UTC** sweep with refreshed anchors and the docx stub now
captures a fully green quick gate while keeping macOS contributors on the stub
path when `lxml` wheels are unavailable.
【F:baseline/logs/task-check-20251007T050924Z.log†L1-L189】【F:tests/stubs/docx.py†L1-L40】
The prior **04:41 UTC** `uv run task verify` log still captures `flake8`
failures across search, cache, and AUTO-mode telemetry modules, so the verify
gate remains closed until those files receive the same hygiene pass.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251006T044116Z.log†L1-L124】 The paired
`uv run task coverage` sweep begins compiling GPU-heavy extras
(`hdbscan==0.8.40` is the first build) and was aborted to preserve the
evaluation window, so coverage remains pegged to the earlier 92.4 % evidence
until the lint cleanup lands.【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251006T044136Z.log†L1-L8】
The updated preflight plan records PR-S1, PR-S2, PR-R0, PR-D0, and PR-A1 as
merged while introducing new follow-up slices for lint repair, cache
determinism, verify/coverage evidence, and telemetry polish; the alpha ticket
mirrors the same checklist with the refreshed evidence snapshot.
【F:docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md†L1-L240】【F:issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md†L1-L210】

### Immediate Follow-ups

- [x] Deliver **PR-D0** – regenerate spec anchors from `SPEC_COVERAGE.md`, add
  manifest drift detection to `scripts/check_spec_tests.py`, harden the docx
  stub fallback for macOS quick gates, and capture the green
  `task check` sweep at 05:09 UTC.
- [x] Ship **PR-S1** – deterministic search stubs, hybrid ranking signatures,
  and refreshed fixtures are merged, keeping canonical queries consistent
  across telemetry and cache layers.【F:src/autoresearch/search/core.py†L650-L686】
  【F:src/autoresearch/search/core.py†L1431-L1468】【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L503-L608】
- [x] Ship **PR-S2** – namespace-aware cache keys and property fixtures now
  prevent redundant backend calls across namespaces and storage hints.
  【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L503-L608】【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L779-L879】
  【F:tests/unit/legacy/test_cache.py†L883-L1010】
- [x] Ship **PR-R0** – AUTO mode claim hydration leverages the reasoning
  payload normalisers and orchestrator merge logic to keep telemetry
  serialisable.【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/reasoning_payloads.py†L1-L166】
  【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/parallel.py†L191-L210】
- [x] Deliver **PR-A1** – specialist agents now normalise `FrozenReasoningStep`
  payloads before prompt construction and the orchestration regression suite
  exercises `ReasoningCollection` in-place additions, maintaining strict typing
  guarantees.【F:src/autoresearch/agents/specialized/summarizer.py†L9-L78】
  【F:src/autoresearch/agents/specialized/critic.py†L9-L101】
  【F:tests/unit/orchestration/test_query_state_features.py†L140-L160】
- [ ] Deliver **PR-L0b** – restore test module hygiene by moving
  `from __future__ import annotations` to the top of each affected file,
  deduplicate imports, and capture a green `uv run task check` log for the
  release dossier.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-T0** – confirm every legacy and distributed test exercises
  the restored helpers, add regression coverage to prevent duplicate import
  drift, and document the pytest collection guardrails.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-S3** – enforce cache-hit canonicalisation across
  `Search.external_lookup` and hybrid enrichment so
  `test_external_lookup_uses_cache` observes a single backend call, then expand
  property coverage around namespace and alias churn.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-L0c** – repair lingering lint fallout (unused imports,
  newline violations) and document the lint baseline before running verify.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-V1** – once lint and collection succeed, capture fresh
  `task verify` and `task coverage` logs without GPU extras, restoring the
  release evidence trail ahead of the tag proposal.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-B1** – expand behaviour coverage for cache hits, warning
  banner isolation, and formatter fidelity once PR-S3 lands.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-E1** – synchronise STATUS.md, TASK_PROGRESS.md, the
  preflight dossier, and the alpha issue with the fresh verify and coverage
  evidence.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-P1** – recalibrate scheduler benchmarks with merged claim
  hydration and deterministic cache behaviour.
- [ ] Resume TestPyPI dry runs once verify and coverage are green, then close
  the remaining [prepare-first-alpha-release](issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
  milestones before proposing the tag.【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251006T044116Z.log†L1-L124】
- [ ] Deliver **PR-O1** – finish output formatter fidelity work so control
  characters and whitespace remain intact across JSON and markdown outputs.
- [ ] Deliver **PR-R1** – confirm warning banners stay in structured telemetry
  while answers remain clean in CLI and API flows.

### High-impact release slices (dialectical synthesis)

- **Cache determinism vs. telemetry breadth:** The failing
  `test_external_lookup_uses_cache` run demonstrates backend calls still fire on
  cache hits. The benefit of tightening canonicalisation outweighs the risk of
  obscuring hybrid telemetry because existing diagnostics already capture raw
  and canonical queries; PR-S3 will enforce single-call behaviour while adding
  property coverage for namespace churn.【7821ab†L1031-L1034】
- **Import hygiene vs. test throughput:** The full-suite pytest run halts on
  SyntaxError because duplicate imports precede `from __future__` directives.
  Moving the directive to the top via PR-L0b marginally slows review but keeps
  the quick gate honest. PR-T0 then codifies the regression guard so future
  contributors cannot reintroduce the ordering slip.
- **Lint hygiene vs. delivery speed:** Verify continues to halt in `flake8`
  even though the quick gate is green, so the next lint repair must isolate the
  highest-churn modules (search, cache, AUTO telemetry) and land as PR-L0c
  before verify can progress. This keeps scope small enough for rapid review
  while clearing the gate that blocks coverage.
- **Evidence freshness vs. runtime cost:** Coverage remains tied to the earlier
  92.4 % run because the last attempt was aborted mid-install. Once PR-L0 and
  PR-S3 land, PR-V1 can rerun verify and coverage without the GPU extra to
  balance evidence freshness with runtime limits.

## Deep Research Enhancement Program
