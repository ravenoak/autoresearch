# Comprehensive Plan for Autoresearch Code Completion

Based on a thorough analysis of the Autoresearch codebase, I've developed a comprehensive plan to bring the project to completion. This plan addresses all aspects of the system, from core functionality to testing and documentation.

## Status

As of **October 2, 2025** the strict gate finally runs clean: the
**23:57 UTC** `uv run mypy --strict src tests` sweep completes without
regressions, replacing the 2,114-error backlog captured on October 1. Phase 2
planner work may resume once follow-on suites confirm the strict gate remains
green, so we continue to reference the passing log directly in the planner
deliverables below. The coverage harness still leans on the late-September
92.4 % run while we decide whether to refresh optional-extra telemetry alongside
the strict uplift, and TestPyPI remains deferred until the alpha directive
lifts. The prior October 1 logs stay archived below for comparison as we confirm
downstream sweeps absorb the stricter typing contract.
【F:baseline/logs/mypy-strict-20251002T235732Z.log†L1-L1】
【F:baseline/logs/mypy-strict-20251001T143959Z.log†L2358-L2377】
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251001T144044Z.log†L122-L241】
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251001T152708Z.log†L60-L166】

As of **September 30, 2025**, Autoresearch still targets an **0.1.0a1** preview
on **September 15, 2026** and a final **0.1.0** release on **October 1, 2026**.
The strict gate is red again: the **14:55 UTC** `task verify` sweep reaches
`mypy --strict` before surfacing 118 untyped fixtures and the
`EvaluationSummary` constructor regression that now expects planner depth and
routing metrics. Coverage evidence from the 18:19 UTC run still records a
92.4 % statement rate, yet the harness must absorb the new signature before the
gate can turn green again. TestPyPI remains on hold until publish rights open,
and the alpha gate tracks the failing strict log alongside the earlier
successful release sweep for context.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T145541Z.log†L1-L120】
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T145541Z.log†L2606-L2617】
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T181947Z.log†L1-L21】
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L18-L85】

XPASS cleanup and the Phase 1 Deep Research objectives are complete: the unit
suite no longer reports XPASS cases after archiving
[retire-stale-xfail-markers-in-unit-suite](issues/archive/retire-stale-xfail-markers-in-unit-suite.md),
and the adaptive gate rollout now publishes audit telemetry through the same
Task CLI paths validated in the September 30 sweeps.
Phase 1 remains documented with the completion note in the deep research plan.
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L214-L233】【F:docs/deep_research_upgrade_plan.md†L19-L36】

The remaining alpha checklist items focus on the TestPyPI dry run and release
sign-off once the publish directive lifts. `docs/release_plan.md` tracks the
open TestPyPI item alongside the archived XPASS and heuristics proof tickets so
the alpha gate stays transparent.
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L200-L236】

### Immediate Follow-ups

- [x] Retire the six XPASS cases documented in
  [retire-stale-xfail-markers-in-unit-suite](issues/archive/retire-stale-xfail-markers-in-unit-suite.md)
  so the unit suite fails fast on regressions.
- [x] Clear the strict typing backlog captured in
  `baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T145541Z.log` and update the evaluation
  harness for the expanded `EvaluationSummary` signature before resuming
  Phase 2 delivery. Follow-on sweeps will guard the green strict gate while the
  planner team restarts Phase 2 milestones.
- [ ] Complete the
  [prepare-first-alpha-release](issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
  milestones while keeping optional-extra coverage sweeps synchronized with
  `TASK_PROGRESS.md`.
- [x] Execute Phase 1 of the Deep Research program under
  [adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout](issues/archive/adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout.md).

## Deep Research Enhancement Program

The dialectical review of September 26, 2025 adds five tracked initiatives to
reach the truthfulness, auditability, and UX targets described in the project
proposal. Each initiative links to the dedicated ticket so progress is visible
alongside the alpha release workstream.

1. **Adaptive gate and claim audits** – Gate policy, scout signals, and
   per-claim audit tables tracked in
   [adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout](issues/archive/adaptive-gate-and-claim-audit-rollout.md).
2. **Planner and coordinator ReAct upgrade** – Structured task graphs, tool
   affinity routing, and telemetry enhancements tracked in
   [planner-coordinator-react-upgrade](issues/planner-coordinator-react-upgrade.md).
3. **Session GraphRAG integration** – Session knowledge graph construction,
   contradiction checks, and artifact exports tracked in
   [session-graph-rag-integration](issues/session-graph-rag-integration.md).
4. **Evaluation and layered UX expansion** – TruthfulQA/FEVER/HotpotQA harness
   automation, layered outputs, and Socratic controls tracked in
   [evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion](issues/evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion.md).
5. **Cost-aware model routing** – Role-based model selection, budgets, and
   telemetry tracked in
   [cost-aware-model-routing](issues/cost-aware-model-routing.md).
