# Example Data Guidelines

These instructions apply to files in the `examples/` directory.

## Snapshot
- **Purpose:** provide minimal, focused usage demonstrations.
- **Primary languages:** Python and Markdown.
- **Key outputs:** runnable scripts and sample datasets.

## Conventions
- Keep examples minimal and self-contained.
- Do not rely on proprietary services or credentials.
- Assume sample data is covered by the project's AGPL-3.0 license unless noted.
- Document third-party assets with their original licenses and required
  attribution.

## Reasoning and Continuous Improvement
- Explain the problem each example addresses and alternative approaches in
  accompanying comments or README sections.
- Update examples when APIs or recommended practices change.

## AGENTS.md Compliance
- Scope: `examples/` directory; nested `AGENTS.md` files override these rules.
- This AGENTS.md follows the [AGENTS.md spec](https://gist.github.com).
