using PySide6 (Qt for Python) instead of web-based Streamlit.

The desktop interface provides:
- Native performance with GPU acceleration
- Multi-window support for comparing queries
- Rich interactions (drag-and-drop, annotations, keyboard shortcuts)
- Professional appearance matching research tools
- Offline-first operation (no server required)
