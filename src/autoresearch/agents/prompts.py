"""
Prompt template system for agent prompts.

This module provides a system for loading, managing, and rendering prompt templates
for agents. Templates can be loaded from configuration files and support variable
substitution.

The prompt template system consists of:
1. PromptTemplate: A Pydantic model for defining templates with variables
2. PromptTemplateRegistry: A registry for storing and retrieving templates
3. Helper functions for working with templates (get_prompt_template, render_prompt)

Templates support variable substitution using the string.Template syntax (${variable}).
Default templates for common agent types are provided, but custom templates can be
defined in configuration files or registered programmatically.
