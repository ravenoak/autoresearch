# Release Sweep Summary (2025-09-24T18:46:46Z)

- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed during `task coverage` while executing `uv run pytest` for unit coverage.
- **Blocker:** `tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend` raises `TypeError` because the mocked `embedding_lookup` lambda only accepts up to two positional arguments but three were provided by `Search.embedding_lookup`.
- **Next Steps:** Adjust the test fixture to accept the optional `return_handles` argument or patch the underlying call so the stub signature matches the production API, then rerun `uv run task release:alpha` to complete the sweep.
