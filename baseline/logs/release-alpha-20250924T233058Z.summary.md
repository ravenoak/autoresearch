# Release Sweep Summary (2025-09-24T23:30:58Z)

- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed during `task verify` while running the unit coverage
  suite.
- **Blocker:** `tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend`
  now records four `embedding_calls` entries once the DuckDB VSS extras load,
  but the fixture still asserts two, so the hybridmethod stub trips on the
  expanded vector-search path.
- **Context:** Storage initialization logs confirm the VSS extension loads then
  reports `Failed to create HNSW index` when enabling experimental persistence;
  the sweep continues after logging the error.
- **Next Steps:** Adjust the stubbed assertions to tolerate the additional
  embedding lookups under VSS, then rerun `uv run task release:alpha` so the
  packaging and publish stages complete.
