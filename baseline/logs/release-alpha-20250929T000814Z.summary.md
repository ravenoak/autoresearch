# Release Sweep Summary (2025-09-29T00:08:14Z)

- **Status:** ‚ùå Failed during `uv run flake8 src tests` when
  `tests/integration/test_streamlit_gui.py:1:1: F401 'os' imported but unused`
  surfaced, so the sweep exited at the lint stage.
- **Blocker:** The integration GUI smoke test still imports `os` without
  reading environment state, leaving flake8 red until the helper is trimmed or
  the lint rule is suppressed.
- **TestPyPI:** Skipped per the active release directive; the pipeline never
  reached the publish stage after documenting the lint failure.
- **Next Steps:** Drop the unused import (or justify it) and rerun
  `uv run task release:alpha` so verify, coverage, packaging, and publish gates
  can proceed under the directive once lint is green.
