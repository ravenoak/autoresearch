# Status

As of **August 30, 2025**, `task check` and `task verify` complete. `task verify`
installs CUDA wheels and runs only the targeted suite, so integration and
behavior tests remain unexecuted. See
[address-task-verify-dependency-builds](issues/address-task-verify-dependency-builds.md)
for dependency optimizations and
[add-test-coverage-for-optional-components](issues/add-test-coverage-for-optional-components.md)
for coverage gaps.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Ran via `task verify`.

## Targeted tests
Ran via `task verify` (21 passed).

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run; a smoke run reported failing scenarios.

## Coverage
Total coverage is **100%** across 57 statements in targeted modules.
