# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the environment was provisioned with Go Task and
required tooling via `scripts/codex_setup.sh`. `task check` fails because
`uv sync --extra dev-minimal` removes test packages, causing
`scripts/check_env.py` to report missing modules. Manual `uv run flake8 src
tests`, `uv run mypy src`, and the quick unit tests pass.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
`uv run flake8 src tests` and `uv run mypy src` ran without errors.
`uv run python scripts/check_spec_tests.py` produced no output, indicating
success.

## Targeted tests
`task verify` runs targeted tests and reported `20 passed, 3 skipped`.

## Integration tests
Not run separately.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
`task verify` reported **100%** coverage for targeted modules. The current
coverage is **100%**, and the run initially failed because `STATUS.md` listed
**91%**, but the file now matches the report.
