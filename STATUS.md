# Status

As of **August 30, 2025**, `task check` succeeds. After running
`scripts/setup.sh`, `task verify` stalls compiling heavy dependencies and still
reports missing package metadata. Integration and behavior suites remain
untested. See [speed-up-task-check] for dependency footprint concerns and
[add-behavior-driven-test-coverage](issues/add-behavior-driven-test-coverage.md)
for behavior tests.
