# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the `task` CLI is installed and `task install` completes. `task check`
ran linting and type checks, but `pytest tests/unit -q` hung and required manual interruption.
Targeted, integration, and behavior suites were not rerun.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
`flake8`, `mypy`, and `scripts/check_spec_tests.py` pass.

## Unit tests
`task check` hangs while running `pytest tests/unit -q`; the run was terminated after prolonged
inactivity.

## Targeted tests
`pytest tests/targeted` still fails during collection: modules `docx` and `pdfminer` are missing.

## Integration tests
Storage initialization raises `AttributeError: 'DuckDBPyConnection' object has no attribute
'fetchone'`, yielding **15 failed, 157 passed, 4 skipped, 93 deselected, 39 errors**.

## Behavior tests
Behavior scenarios trigger the same DuckDB initialization error and all fail.

## Coverage
Coverage was not recomputed; unit subset coverage remains at **91%**.
