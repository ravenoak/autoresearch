# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the environment installs Go Task but leaves `.venv/bin` outside
`PATH`. After exporting `PATH`, `task check` fails because `uv sync --extra dev-minimal`
removes `pytest_bdd`, `freezegun`, and `hypothesis`. `scripts/check_env.py` reports these modules
missing, so both `task check` and `task verify` exit early without running tests. Extension
bootstrap was not reached.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Not run due to environment failures.

## Targeted tests
Not run. `task verify` exits during environment checks.

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Not generated because `task verify` fails before executing tests.
