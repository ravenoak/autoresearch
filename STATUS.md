# Status

As of **September 1, 2025**, the Go Task CLI was installed and unit tests run
with `uv run pytest tests/unit` complete in ~17s when excluding slow markers.
The `test_backup_scheduler_start_stop` case previously stalled because its
mock timer recursively invoked itself; it now uses a real timer and an event
signal to stop cleanly. `BackupScheduler.stop` also joins timer threads to
avoid lingering resources.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Not re-run in this session.

## Targeted tests
`uv run pytest tests/unit -m 'not slow'` â†’ **10 passed, 1 skipped, 22 deselected**
but was interrupted after reporting due to manual termination.

## Integration tests
Not executed.

## Behavior tests
Not executed.

## Coverage
`uv run task coverage` started but was interrupted; `coverage.xml` was not
generated.
