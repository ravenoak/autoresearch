# Status

As of **August 31, 2025**, `task check` and `task verify` are blocked by a missing
`task` command. A direct `uv run pytest` attempt fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError: pytest_bdd`, so no tests execute.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Not run.

## Targeted tests
Not run.

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Total coverage is **100%**
