# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, `scripts/setup.sh` installed the Go Task CLI and
development environment. Running `task check` executed linting, type checks, and
spec tests. Unit tests completed (84 passed, 1 skipped, 29 deselected) before a
manual interrupt prior to integration tests. Targeted and behavior suites were
not exercised.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Completed via `task check`.

## Unit tests
84 passed, 1 skipped, 29 deselected before interruption.

## Targeted tests
`task verify` fails during collection because `pdfminer.six` and `python-docx`
are missing.

## Integration tests
Not run; `task check` interrupted before execution.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Coverage was not recomputed; prior unit subset coverage remains at **91%**.
