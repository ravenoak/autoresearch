# Status

As of **August 29, 2025**, the evaluation environment does not expose the
`task` CLI, and direct test invocation fails due to missing plugins. Attempts
to run `task check` or `task verify` fail with `command not found: task`, and
`uv run pytest -q` raises `ImportError: No module named 'pytest_bdd'`.
Integration and behavior suites therefore remain untested. See
[speed-up-task-check] for dependency footprint concerns and
[add-behavior-driven-test-coverage](issues/add-behavior-driven-test-coverage.md)
for behavior tests.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Did not run; the `task` command is unavailable.

## Targeted tests
Did not run; the `task` command is unavailable and `pytest_bdd` is missing.

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Not computed due to failing test invocation.
