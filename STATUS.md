# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, `task install` bootstrapped Go Task and the minimal
development extras on a clean clone. `task check` completed in ~22 s after
syncing only the `dev-minimal` extra. Previously, `task verify` failed early
because `flake8`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pytest_bdd`, `pytest_httpx`, `tomli_w`, and
`redis` were missing.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
`task check` finished in ~22 s with `flake8`, `mypy`, and spec tests passing.

## Unit tests
8 selected unit tests passed.

## Targeted tests
Not run.
