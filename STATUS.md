# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the Go Task CLI is unavailable, so `task install`
could not run. We invoked `uv run --extra test pytest`, which executed 84 unit
tests before a manual interrupt with **956** remaining. Targeted, integration,
and behavior suites were not exercised.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Not run; blocked by missing `task` CLI.

## Unit tests
`uv run --extra test pytest` reported 84 passed, 4 skipped, 122 deselected before
interruption at `storage_backup.py`.

## Targeted tests
Still fail during collection because `pdfminer.six` and `python-docx` are
missing.

## Integration tests
Not rerun; existing runs raise `AttributeError: 'DuckDBPyConnection' object has
no attribute 'fetchone'` during schema initialization.

## Behavior tests
Not rerun; expected to fail with the same DuckDB initialization error.

## Coverage
Coverage was not recomputed; prior unit subset coverage remains at **91%**.
