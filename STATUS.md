# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the environment bootstraps successfully and `.venv/bin` is on
`PATH`, but `task check` still fails. Running `uv sync --extra dev-minimal` removes
`pytest_bdd`, `freezegun`, and `hypothesis`, and `scripts/check_env.py` reports these modules
missing. Both `task check` and `task verify` exit before tests execute, so the DuckDB
vector extension bootstrap is skipped. See
[fix-task-check-deps] for tracking.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Not run due to environment failures.

## Targeted tests
Not run. `task verify` exits during environment checks.

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Not generated because `task verify` fails before executing tests.
