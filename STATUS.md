# Status

As of **August 24, 2025**, these results reflect attempts to exercise the
development workflow. Environment provisioning used `scripts/codex_setup.sh`
to install `task` (v3.44.1) and required development dependencies. Refer to the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [release plan](docs/release_plan.md) for
scheduled milestones.

## Lint and type checks
```text
uv run flake8 src tests
uv run mypy src
```
Result: both commands completed without issues after installing
`flake8`, `mypy`, and related dependencies.

## Unit tests
```text
task check
task verify
```
Result: both commands execute but fail due to monitor CLI metrics tests
asserting `130 == 0` in
`tests/unit/test_monitor_cli.py::test_monitor_metrics` and
`::test_monitor_prompts_and_passes_callbacks`. Coverage not collected.

## Integration tests
```text
uv run pytest tests/integration -m requires_distributed -q
```
Result: 2 passed, 3 skipped, confirming `redis` is available.

## Spec tests
```text
uv run scripts/check_spec_tests.py
```
Result: completed without reported issues.

## Behavior tests
```text
uv run pytest tests/behavior/features/api_orchestrator_integration.feature -q
```
Result: `ERROR: not found: ... (no match in any of [<Dir features>])`.
