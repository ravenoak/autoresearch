optional extras. `task check` passes, but `task verify` fails: 19
behavior-driven tests lack step definitions, so coverage is not reported.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Passed via `task check`.

## Targeted tests
Passed during `task verify`.

## Integration tests
Not executed.

## Behavior tests
Fail: missing step definitions in 19 scenarios.

## Coverage
