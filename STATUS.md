# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, `scripts/setup.sh` installed the Go Task CLI and
development environment. Running `task check` executed linting, type checks, and
spec tests. A reduced unit subset now passes quickly (9 tests in under a
second) while integration and behavior suites remain skipped.

On a fresh clone (`uv sync --no-cache`), syncing only the `dev-minimal` extra
for `task check` took approximately **5.45s**, down from **5.61s** when
installing both `dev-minimal` and `test` extras. The slimmer dependency set
shaved roughly **3%** off setup time.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
Completed via `task check`.

## Unit tests
9 passed in the slim subset exercised by `task check`.

## Targeted tests
`task verify` fails during collection because `pdfminer.six` and `python-docx`
are missing.

## Integration tests
Not run; `task check` interrupted before execution.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Coverage was not recomputed; prior unit subset coverage remains at **91%**.
