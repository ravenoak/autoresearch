# Status

These results reflect attempts to run `task check` after installing
development dependencies. The `task` utility was not pre-installed and
required manual installation, and several Python extras were missing.
Refer to the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and
[release plan](docs/release_plan.md) for scheduled milestones.

## Lint and type checks
```text
uv run flake8 src tests
uv run mypy src
```
Result: both commands completed without issues after installing
`flake8`, `mypy`, and related dependencies.

## Unit tests
```text
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_monitor_cli.py -k test_monitor_metrics -q
```
Result: initial run failed due to missing `pytest_httpx` and `tomli_w`.
After installing the packages, the targeted test passed. The full unit
suite has not been executed.

## Integration tests
Not executed.

## Spec tests
```text
uv run scripts/check_spec_tests.py
```
Result: not executed.

## Behavior tests
Not executed.
