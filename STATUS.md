# Status

As of **August 28, 2025**, the local environment installs Go Task, but `task check`
fails because `uv sync --extra dev-minimal` removes `pytest_bdd`, `freezegun`, and
`hypothesis`. The subsequent `scripts/check_env.py` call reports these modules
missing, causing `task check` and `task verify` to exit early without running
tests. The extension bootstrap script still fails to catch `duckdb.Error`, leaving
the vector search extension absent.

## Lint, type checks, and spec tests
`uv run flake8 src tests` and `uv run mypy src` ran without errors.
`uv run python scripts/check_spec_tests.py` produced no output, indicating success.

## Targeted tests
Not run. `task verify` exits during environment checks.

## Integration tests
Not run.

## Behavior tests
Not run.

## Coverage
Not generated because `task verify` fails before executing tests.
