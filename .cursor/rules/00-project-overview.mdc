# Autoresearch Project Overview

## Purpose
AI-assisted research orchestration framework providing automated research workflows
through a Python library, CLI, and comprehensive documentation.

## Core Philosophy
- **Clarity**: Write clear, self-documenting code with comprehensive docstrings
- **Safety**: Prioritize type safety, error handling, and defensive programming
- **Maintainability**: Favor readable, testable code over clever optimizations
- **Reasoning**: Apply dialectical and Socratic reasoning to all decisions:
  * State assumptions explicitly
  * Question and explore alternatives
  * Synthesize well-grounded conclusions
  * Document key reasoning in commits and PRs

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Package Manager**: uv (prefix standalone commands with `uv run`)
- **Formatter**: black
- **Linter**: flake8
- **Type Checker**: mypy
- **Task Runner**: Task (Taskfile.yml)

## Key Commands
- `task install` - Initialize environment and install dependencies
- `task check` - Fast linting, type checks, and tests (run early and often)
- `task verify` - Full linting, type checks, and test suite with coverage (run before commits)
- `task clean` - Remove build artifacts

## Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 with 4-space indentation
- Keep lines ≤ 100 characters
- Include docstrings for all public APIs
- Use type hints throughout
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Avoid committing binary artifacts; prefer text formats
