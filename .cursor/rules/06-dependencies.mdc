# Dependency Management Guidelines

## Package Manager: uv
This project uses `uv` for fast, reliable Python package management.

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Install project and dependencies
uv sync

# Add a dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a dev dependency
uv add --dev package-name

# Add an optional dependency (extras)
uv add --optional extra-name package-name

# Run a command in the virtual environment
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest
uv run task verify

# Update dependencies
uv lock --upgrade
```

## Dependency Organization

### Core Dependencies
Required for basic functionality:
- Runtime dependencies in `[project.dependencies]`
- Keep minimal and well-justified
- Pin major versions, allow minor/patch updates
- Example: `requests>=2.31,<3.0`

### Optional Dependencies (Extras)
Grouped by feature or use case:
- `dev-minimal` - Essential development tools
- `test` - Testing frameworks and tools
- `gpu` - GPU-accelerated computing
- `distributed` - Distributed computing (Ray)
- `docs` - Documentation generation
- `ui` - Web UI components

Example in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev-minimal = [
    "black>=24.0.0",
    "flake8>=7.0.0",
    "mypy>=1.8.0",
]
test = [
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0",
]
```

### Development Dependencies
Install with: `task install` or `uv sync --extra dev-minimal --extra test`

## Version Constraints

### Specifying Versions
- Use `>=X.Y,<X+1.0` for libraries (allow minor updates)
- Use `~=X.Y.Z` for tools (allow patch updates only)
- Pin exact versions only when necessary (security, known issues)
- Document why strict pins are needed

Examples:
```toml
# Library - allow minor updates
requests = ">=2.31,<3.0"

# Tool - allow patch updates
black = "~=24.1.0"

# Pinned for specific reason
numpy = "==1.24.0"  # Required for GPU compatibility
```

### Version Ranges to Avoid
- Unbounded ranges: `package>=1.0` (too permissive)
- Wildcards: `package==1.*` (use `~=` instead)
- Multiple constraints without reason: `package>=1.0,<=2.0,!=1.5`

## Adding Dependencies

### Before Adding a Dependency
Ask these questions (Socratic reasoning):
1. **Necessity**: Is this truly needed or can we implement it simply?
2. **Maintenance**: Is the package actively maintained?
3. **License**: Is the license compatible (check LICENSE file)?
4. **Size**: What is the dependency footprint?
5. **Alternatives**: Are there better-maintained or lighter alternatives?
6. **Security**: Does it have known vulnerabilities?

### Adding a New Dependency
1. Research the package thoroughly
2. Check latest stable version
3. Review documentation and examples
4. Add with appropriate version constraint
5. Document why it's needed (in commit or docs)
6. Update `uv.lock`: `uv lock`
7. Test that it works: `task verify`

## Updating Dependencies

### Regular Updates
- Review dependency updates monthly
- Read changelogs before updating
- Test thoroughly after updates
- Update in separate PR with reasoning

### Security Updates
- Apply immediately for critical vulnerabilities
- Test expeditiously but thoroughly
- Document CVE or security advisory
- Consider patching if update breaks compatibility

### Update Workflow
```bash
# Check for updates
uv lock --upgrade

# Review changes
git diff uv.lock

# Test with updates
task verify

# Commit with explanation
git commit -m "chore(deps): update dependencies

- Update package X to vY.Z for security fix (CVE-XXXX-YYYY)
- Update package A to vB.C for performance improvements
  
All tests passing. No breaking changes."
```

## Lock File Management

### uv.lock
- **Always commit**: Lock file ensures reproducible builds
- **Keep updated**: Run `uv lock` after any dependency change
- **Don't edit manually**: Let uv manage it
- **Resolve conflicts**: Regenerate if conflicts in merge

## Type Stubs

### Type Hints for Third-Party Packages
- Install type stubs from `types-*` packages when available
- Create custom stubs in `typings/` for packages without types
- Document stub creation in commit message

Example:
```bash
# Add type stubs for requests
uv add --dev types-requests

# Custom stubs
# Create typings/packagename/__init__.pyi
```

## Platform-Specific Dependencies

### Handling Platform Differences
Use environment markers for platform-specific deps:

```toml
[project.dependencies]
windows-specific = { version = ">=1.0", markers = "sys_platform == 'win32'" }
unix-specific = { version = ">=1.0", markers = "sys_platform != 'win32'" }
```

## Wheel Management

### Custom Wheels
- Store in `wheels/` directory if needed
- Document why custom wheel is necessary
- Include building instructions
- Update when upstream fixes issue

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependency conflicts**: Try `uv lock --upgrade` or relax constraints
2. **Missing packages**: Ensure you've run `uv sync`
3. **Version mismatches**: Check Python version (requires 3.12+)
4. **Cache issues**: Try `uv clean` to clear cache

### Getting Help
- Check `uv --help` for command reference
- Review `pyproject.toml` for project configuration
- See `docs/installation.md` for setup details
