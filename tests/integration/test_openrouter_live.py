"""Live integration tests for OpenRouter API using free-tier models.

These tests exercise real LLM-related code paths using live OpenRouter APIs.
They use only free-tier models to avoid costs during testing.

Requirements:
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable must be set
- Tests are marked as 'slow' and will be skipped if API key is not available
- Only free-tier models are used for testing
