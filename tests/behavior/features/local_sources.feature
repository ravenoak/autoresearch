Feature: Search Local Sources
  As a researcher
  I want to query local files and repositories
  So that I can reference my offline materials

  # Spec: docs/specs/search.md#key-behaviors - Query local directories, document formats and Git repositories
  Scenario: Searching a directory for text files
    Given a directory with text files
    When I search the directory for "hello"
    Then I should get results from the text files

  # Spec: docs/specs/search.md#key-behaviors - Query local directories, document formats and Git repositories
  Scenario: Searching a directory for PDF and DOCX files
    Given a directory with PDF and DOCX files
    When I search the directory for "hello"
    Then I should get results from the PDF and DOCX files

  # Spec: docs/specs/search.md#key-behaviors - Query local directories, document formats and Git repositories
  Scenario: Searching a local Git repository for code snippets or commit messages
    Given a local Git repository with commits containing "TODO"
    When I search the repository for "TODO"
    Then I should see results referencing commit messages or code

  # Spec: docs/specs/search.md#key-behaviors - Query local directories, document formats and Git repositories
  Scenario: Searching commit diffs and metadata in a local Git repository
    Given a local Git repository with diffs containing "FIXME"
    When I search the repository for "FIXME"
    Then I should see commit diff results with metadata

  # Spec: docs/specs/search.md#key-behaviors - Query local directories, document formats and Git repositories
  Scenario: Searching commit diffs with code context
    Given a local Git repository with diffs containing "CONTEXT"
    When I search the repository for "CONTEXT"
    Then the diff results should include surrounding code context

  # Spec: docs/specs/research_federation_enhancements.md#enhancement-a
  Scenario: Searching across a repository manifest yields provenance labels
    Given a repository manifest with labelled Git repositories
    When I search the repository manifest for "shared-term"
    Then I should see manifest results grouped by repository slug
    And each manifest result includes provenance metadata
