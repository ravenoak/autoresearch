# Logging Subsystem Feature Tests

Feature: Comprehensive Logging Subsystem
  As a system administrator
  I want a robust logging system that handles security, performance, and consistency
  So that I can monitor, debug, and audit the application effectively

  Background:
    Given the logging system is configured with default settings
    And the application is running in a test environment

  @security @sensitive_data
  Scenario: Automatic sanitization of sensitive data in logs
    When a log entry contains an API key "sk-1234567890abcdef"
    And a log entry contains a password "secret123"
    And a log entry contains an email address "user@example.com"
    And a log entry contains a credit card number "4532-1234-5678-9012"
    Then the API key should be replaced with "[REDACTED]"
    And the password should be replaced with "[REDACTED]"
    And the email address should be replaced with "[REDACTED]"
    And the credit card number should be replaced with "[REDACTED]"
    And the log structure should be preserved

  @security @sensitive_data
  Scenario: Nested sensitive data sanitization
    When a log entry contains nested data with sensitive information
      | user | password | api_key |
      | alice | secret123 | sk-1234567890abcdef |
    And the nested data contains URLs with credentials "https://user:pass@example.com"
    Then all sensitive values should be replaced with "[REDACTED]"
    And nested structure should be maintained
    And field names should be preserved

  @security @audit
  Scenario: Security audit logging for authentication events
    When a user attempts to authenticate with valid credentials
    Then an audit log entry should be created with event_type "auth_attempt"
    And the audit log should include actor, action, resource, outcome, and timestamp
    And the audit log should not be affected by log sampling
    And the audit log should be stored separately from application logs

  @security @audit
  Scenario: Security audit logging for authorization failures
    When a user attempts unauthorized access to a protected resource
    Then an audit log entry should be created with event_type "authz_failure"
    And the audit log should include the failed resource and user context
    And the audit log should include the IP address and user agent

  @correlation @integration
  Scenario: Correlation ID propagation across CLI command execution
    When I execute a CLI command that triggers multiple operations
    Then a single correlation ID should be generated for the entire command
    And all log entries from the command should include the same correlation_id
    And the correlation_id should be propagated through all nested operations

  @correlation @integration
  Scenario: Correlation ID propagation across API request lifecycle
    Given an API request with header "X-Correlation-ID: req-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
    When the API processes the request through multiple service layers
    Then all log entries should include the provided correlation_id
    And the correlation_id should be available throughout the request lifecycle
    And if no correlation_id is provided, one should be automatically generated

  @correlation @integration @legacy_streamlit
  Scenario: Correlation ID propagation across Streamlit session
    When a user interacts with the Streamlit GUI
    Then a session-based correlation ID should be generated
    And all log entries from that session should include the correlation_id
    And the correlation_id should persist across multiple user actions

  @correlation @integration
  Scenario: Correlation ID propagation across MCP distributed execution
    When an MCP request triggers distributed agent execution
    Then the correlation_id should be propagated across all nodes
    And all agent execution logs should include the correlation_id
    And the correlation_id should be traceable through the entire execution graph

  @performance @sampling
  Scenario: Log sampling reduces overhead under high volume
    Given the logging system is configured with sampling rate of 0.1
    When 1000 log entries are generated rapidly
    Then only approximately 100 entries should be logged (10% sampling rate)
    And the sampling should be deterministic based on message content
    And ERROR and CRITICAL level logs should never be sampled

  @performance @overhead
  Scenario: Logging overhead measurement and validation
    When I measure the performance overhead of logging
    Then the average latency per log entry should be less than 1ms
    And the total overhead should be less than 5% of application performance
    And memory usage should grow linearly with log volume
    And no memory leaks should occur over extended periods

  @performance @async
  Scenario: Asynchronous logging prevents blocking
    Given async logging is enabled with a bounded queue
    When the application generates logs faster than they can be processed
    Then the logging should not block the main application threads
    And queued entries should be processed when capacity becomes available
    And the queue size should not exceed the configured limit

  @configuration @dynamic
  Scenario: Dynamic log level changes take effect immediately
    Given the logging system is configured with INFO level
    When I change the log level to DEBUG via API endpoint
    Then DEBUG level logs should immediately start appearing
    And the change should be audited in the security log
    And INFO level logs should continue to be filtered

  @configuration @dynamic
  Scenario: Runtime configuration validation prevents invalid settings
    When I attempt to set an invalid log level "INVALID_LEVEL"
    Then the configuration change should be rejected
    And an error should be logged with the invalid configuration
    And the previous valid configuration should remain in effect

  @error_handling @fallback
  Scenario: Logging failures do not crash the application
    Given the primary logging sink becomes unavailable
    When the application attempts to log a message
    Then the application should continue running normally
    And a fallback logging mechanism should be used
    And a warning should be logged about the logging failure

  @error_handling @recovery
  Scenario: Automatic recovery from transient logging failures
    Given the logging system experiences a temporary failure
    When the underlying issue is resolved
    Then logging should automatically resume normal operation
    And no log entries should be lost during the failure period
    And a recovery event should be logged

  @multi_threading @safety
  Scenario: Thread-safe logging under concurrent access
    Given multiple threads are logging simultaneously
    When each thread generates log entries with correlation IDs
    Then each thread should maintain its own correlation context
    And log entries should not be corrupted or interleaved
    And correlation IDs should be correctly associated with their originating threads

  @multi_threading @safety
  Scenario: Context isolation between concurrent operations
    When multiple operations run concurrently with different correlation IDs
    Then each operation should maintain its own logging context
    And log entries from different operations should not interfere
    And correlation IDs should be correctly propagated within each operation's scope

  @integration @cli
  Scenario: CLI interface logging integration
    When I execute a CLI command with verbose output
    Then structured logs should be generated with appropriate correlation IDs
    And progress information should be logged with timing data
    And error messages should include actionable suggestions
    And the correlation ID should be traceable through the entire command execution

  @integration @api
  Scenario: API interface logging integration
    Given an API request is made to a protected endpoint
    When the request goes through authentication and authorization
    Then request logging should include timing information
    And authentication events should be audited
    And authorization decisions should be logged
    And the correlation ID should be available throughout the request lifecycle

  @integration @gui @legacy_streamlit
  Scenario: Streamlit GUI logging integration
    When a user interacts with the Streamlit interface
    Then session-based correlation should be established
    And user actions should be logged with appropriate context
    And error conditions should be logged with user-friendly messages
    And performance metrics should be available in the dashboard

  @integration @mcp
  Scenario: MCP interface logging integration
    When an MCP request triggers multi-agent execution
    Then agent execution should be traced with correlation IDs
    Then performance metrics should be collected per agent
    Then cross-node communication should maintain correlation
    And the entire execution graph should be traceable

  @monitoring @health
  Scenario: Logging system health monitoring
    When the logging system is operating normally
    Then health check endpoints should report logging as healthy
    And runtime statistics should be available via API
    And performance metrics should be within acceptable ranges
    And no errors should be reported in logging system status

  @monitoring @alerts
  Scenario: Performance threshold alerts
    Given performance monitoring is enabled
    When logging overhead exceeds 5% of total application performance
    Then an alert should be generated
    And the alert should include current performance metrics
    And the alert should suggest potential remediation steps

  @monitoring @metrics
  Scenario: Comprehensive logging metrics collection
    When the application is running with logging enabled
    Then metrics should be collected for log volume by level
    And metrics should be collected for average log entry latency
    And metrics should be collected for sanitization performance
    And metrics should be collected for sampling effectiveness
    And all metrics should be available via the monitoring API
