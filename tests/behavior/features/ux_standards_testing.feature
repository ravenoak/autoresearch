Feature: UX/UI Standards Testing
  As a user interface standards validator
  I want comprehensive testing of UX/UI standards compliance
  So that the application meets accessibility and usability requirements

  Background:
    Given the Autoresearch application is running

  @accessibility
  Scenario: WCAG 2.1 AA Color Contrast Compliance
    When I run `autoresearch search "test query"` in normal mode
    Then all text should meet WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast requirements
    And background colors should provide sufficient contrast
    And color should not be the only means of conveying information

  @accessibility
  Scenario: Screen Reader Compatibility
    When I run `autoresearch search "test query" --bare-mode`
    Then all output should be compatible with screen readers
    And no essential information should be conveyed only through color
    And all interactive elements should have text alternatives
    And headings should be properly structured (H1-H6)

  @accessibility
  Scenario: Keyboard Navigation Support
    When I use the Streamlit interface
    Then all functionality should be accessible via keyboard only
    And tab order should be logical and follow page structure
    And focus indicators should be clearly visible
    And skip links should be provided for main content areas

  @usability
  Scenario: Consistent Interaction Patterns
    When I use different Autoresearch interfaces
    Then interaction patterns should be consistent across CLI and GUI
    And similar actions should require similar user input
    And error recovery should follow the same patterns
    And help systems should be consistently available

  @usability
  Scenario: Progressive Disclosure Implementation
    When I use depth controls in the CLI
    Then information should be revealed progressively
    And users should be able to access more detail when needed
    And basic information should be visible by default
    And advanced options should not overwhelm beginners

  @usability
  Scenario: Error Message Usability
    When I trigger various error conditions
    Then error messages should be clear and understandable
    And error messages should suggest specific actions to resolve issues
    And error messages should avoid technical jargon
    And error messages should be consistent in tone and format

  @usability
  Scenario: Response Time Expectations
    When I run typical queries
    Then initial feedback should appear within 2 seconds
    And progress indicators should update regularly during long operations
    And operations should complete within reasonable time limits
    And users should be informed of expected wait times

  @cross-platform
  Scenario: Windows Terminal Compatibility
    When I run Autoresearch in Windows Terminal
    Then color output should work correctly
    And Unicode symbols should display properly
    And terminal width detection should work
    And line endings should be handled correctly

  @cross-platform
  Scenario: Linux Terminal Compatibility
    When I run Autoresearch in various Linux terminals
    Then color output should work in gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm
    And Unicode symbols should display correctly
    And terminal capabilities should be detected properly
    And different locale settings should be handled

  @cross-platform
  Scenario: macOS Terminal Compatibility
    When I run Autoresearch in macOS Terminal or iTerm2
    Then color output should work correctly
    And Unicode symbols should display properly
    And terminal width detection should work
    And different shell environments should be supported

  @performance
  Scenario: UI Responsiveness Under Load
    When I run multiple concurrent queries
    Then the UI should remain responsive
    And progress indicators should update smoothly
    And memory usage should remain stable
    And CPU usage should not spike excessively

  @performance
  Scenario: Memory Efficiency
    When I run queries with large result sets
    Then memory usage should scale appropriately
    And memory should be released after operations complete
    And no memory leaks should occur
    And garbage collection should not cause UI freezing

  @standards
  Scenario: Semantic HTML Structure
    When I use the Streamlit interface
    Then HTML should use semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, article)
    And heading hierarchy should be logical (H1-H6)
    And landmarks should be properly defined
    And form controls should have proper labels

  @standards
  Scenario: ARIA Implementation
    When I use interactive elements in the GUI
    Then ARIA labels should be provided for complex widgets
    And ARIA roles should be used appropriately
    And live regions should announce dynamic content changes
    And form validation should be announced to screen readers
