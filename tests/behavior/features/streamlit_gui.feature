Feature: Streamlit GUI Features
  As a user
  I want a web-based GUI for Autoresearch
  So that I can interact with the system in a more visual way

  Background:
    Given the Streamlit application is running

  Scenario: Formatted Answer Display with Markdown Rendering
    When I enter a query that returns Markdown-formatted content
    Then the answer should be displayed with proper Markdown rendering
    And formatting elements like headers, lists, and code blocks should be properly styled
    And math expressions in LaTeX format should be properly rendered

  Scenario: Tabbed Interface for Results
    When I run a query in the Streamlit interface
    Then the results should be displayed in a tabbed interface
    And there should be tabs for "Citations", "Reasoning", "Metrics", and "Knowledge Graph"
    And I should be able to switch between tabs without losing information

  Scenario: Knowledge Graph Visualization
    When I run a query that generates a knowledge graph
    Then the knowledge graph should be visualized in the "Knowledge Graph" tab
    And the visualization should show relationships between concepts
    And the nodes should be color-coded by type

  Scenario: Configuration Editor Interface
    When I navigate to the configuration section
    Then I should see a form with configuration options
    And the form should have validation for input fields
    And I should be able to save changes to the configuration
    And I should see feedback when the configuration is saved

  Scenario: Agent Interaction Trace Visualization
    When I run a query in the Streamlit interface
    Then an interaction trace should be displayed
    And progress metrics should be visualized
