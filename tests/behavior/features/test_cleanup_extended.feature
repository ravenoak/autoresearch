Feature: Extended test cleanup verification
  As a developer
  I want to ensure that tests clean up all resources properly
  So that tests don't interfere with each other

  Scenario: Tests clean up temporary files properly
    Given the system creates temporary files during testing
    When I run a test that creates temporary files
    Then all temporary files should be properly cleaned up

  Scenario: Tests clean up environment variables properly
    Given the system modifies environment variables during testing
    When I run a test that modifies environment variables
    Then all environment variables should be properly restored

  Scenario: Tests handle cleanup errors gracefully
    Given the system encounters errors during cleanup
    When I run a test that encounters cleanup errors
    Then the test should handle cleanup errors gracefully
