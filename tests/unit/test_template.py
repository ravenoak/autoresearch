"""Template for unit tests in the Autoresearch project.

This template provides a standardized structure for unit tests to ensure
consistency across the codebase. It includes examples of different test
patterns, fixture usage, and parameterization.

Usage:
    1. Copy this template to create a new test file
    2. Replace the imports with the appropriate ones for your module
    3. Replace the example tests with your actual tests
    4. Follow the naming and structure conventions
