# Security Policy

## Overview

Autoresearch follows security best practices to protect user data and system integrity. This document outlines our security measures and reporting procedures.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

**API Key Authentication**:
- API keys are loaded from environment variables or configuration files
- Keys are validated using constant-time comparison (`secrets.compare_digest`)
- Multiple API keys supported with role-based access control
- No API keys stored in code or version control

**Input Validation**:
- All user inputs validated using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Path traversal protection in file operations
- Command injection prevention in subprocess calls

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling**:
- API keys and tokens filtered from logs using `SensitiveDataFilter`
- No secrets logged at INFO or DEBUG levels
- Structured logging with secure defaults

**Encryption**:
- No sensitive data stored in plain text
- Configuration loaded from secure sources (environment, encrypted files)

### Dependency Security

**Regular Audits**:
- `pip-audit` run regularly to identify vulnerabilities
- Dependencies updated for security fixes
- Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface

**Current Status** (October 17, 2025):
- ✅ Zero high/critical vulnerabilities in dependencies
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- ✅ Authentication properly implemented
- ⚠️ pip itself has a known vulnerability (GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph) - not actionable

## Security Considerations

### For Users

**API Keys**:
- Store API keys in environment variables, not configuration files
- Use strong, unique keys for production deployments
- Rotate keys regularly

**Network Security**:
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Consider firewall rules to restrict access
- Monitor for unusual access patterns

**Data Handling**:
- Be aware that research queries and results are stored locally
- Consider data retention policies for sensitive research topics

### For Developers

**Code Security**:
- All inputs validated before processing
- SQL queries use parameterized statements
- File paths validated to prevent traversal attacks
- Subprocess calls use safe argument handling

**Testing Security**:
- No real API keys used in tests
- Mock external services in integration tests
- Secure defaults in test fixtures

## Vulnerability Reporting

### How to Report

**Security Issues**:
- Email: security@autoresearch.dev
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities

**Response Timeline**:
- Acknowledge report within 24 hours
- Initial assessment within 3 business days
- Fix development begins immediately for critical issues
- Public disclosure after fix verified

### Bug Bounty

Currently no formal bug bounty program, but security researchers are appreciated and credited in release notes.

## Security Updates

### Version 0.1.0 (Current)

**Security Improvements**:
- Enhanced input validation in API endpoints
- Improved secret filtering in logs
- Better error handling to prevent information leakage
- Dependency audit integration

**Known Security Considerations**:
- Local storage of research data (consider encryption for sensitive topics)
- External API key management (users responsible for key security)
- No built-in rate limiting (implement at infrastructure level)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] End-to-end encryption for sensitive research
- [ ] Built-in rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Audit logging for compliance scenarios
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Compliance

Autoresearch is designed for research use and does not currently target specific compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.). For compliance requirements, please contact us to discuss custom implementations.
