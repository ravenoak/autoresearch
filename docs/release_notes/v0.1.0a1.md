## Features

- CLI, HTTP API and Streamlit interfaces for executing queries.
- Hybrid DuckDB and RDF knowledge graph with plugin-based search backends.
- Prometheus metrics, interactive mode and graph visualization utilities.

- `slowapi` (==0.1.9)

## Release steps

1. Run `task verify` to ensure lint, type checks, and tests pass with coverage
   at or above 90%.
2. Build the distribution.

   ```bash
   uv run python -m build
   uv run scripts/publish_dev.py --dry-run
   ```

3. Tag and push the release.

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0a1
   git push origin v0.1.0a1
   ```

## Known gaps

- Integration tests are skipped.
- Coverage reflects only modules exercised by the test suite.
- Installing all extras pulls large wheels and may require significant disk
  space.
- Packaging commands use `uv run python -m build` followed by
  `uv run scripts/publish_dev.py --dry-run`.
