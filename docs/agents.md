# Agents

Autoresearch orchestrates multiple agents in a dialectical cycle. The default roster includes:

- **Synthesizer** – proposes initial answers.
- **Contrarian** – challenges assumptions and provides counter arguments.
- **Fact Checker** – verifies claims against reliable sources.

Agents communicate via a shared state object and can be customized in `autoresearch.toml`.
