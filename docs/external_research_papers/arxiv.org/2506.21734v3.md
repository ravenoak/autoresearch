**Abstract**

Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences,
remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive
data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel
recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass
without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent
modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The
model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on
challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes.
Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows
on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial
general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM’s potential as a transformative
advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

### **1 Introduction**

Deep learning, as its name suggests, emerged from the idea of stacking more layers to achieve
increased representation power and improved performance [1][,][2] . However, despite the remarkable
success of large language models, their core architecture is paradoxically shallow [3] . This imposes
a fundamental constraint on their most sought-after capability: reasoning. The fixed depth of standard Transformers places them in computational complexity classes such as _AC_ [0] or _TC_ [0][ 4], preventing them from solving problems that require polynomial time [5][,][6] . LLMs are not Turing-complete
and thus they cannot, at least in a purely end-to-end manner, execute complex algorithmic reasoning that is necessary for deliberate planning or symbolic manipulation tasks [7][,][8] . For example,
our results on the Sudoku task show that increasing Transformer model depth _can_ improve performance, [1] but performance remains far from optimal even with very deep models (see Figure 2),
which supports the conjectured limitations of the LLM scaling paradigm [9] .

The LLMs literature has relied largely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning [10] .
CoT externalizes reasoning into token-level language by breaking down complex tasks into simpler intermediate steps, sequentially generating text using a shallow model [11] . However, CoT for
reasoning is a crutch, not a satisfactory solution. It relies on brittle, human-defined decompositions
where a single misstep or a misorder of the steps can derail the reasoning process entirely [12][,][13] . This
dependency on explicit linguistic steps tethers reasoning to patterns at the token level. As a result,
CoT reasoning often requires significant amount of training data and generates a large number of
tokens for complex reasoning tasks, resulting in slow response times. A more efficient approach is
needed to minimize these data requirements [14] .

Towards this goal, we explore “latent reasoning”, where the model conducts computations within
its internal hidden state space [15][,][16] . This aligns with the understanding that language is a tool for
human communication, not the substrate of thought itself [17] ; the brain sustains lengthy, coherent
chains of reasoning with remarkable efficiency in a latent space, without constant translation back
to language. However, the power of latent reasoning is still fundamentally constrained by a model’s
_effective computational depth_ . Naively stacking layers is notoriously difficult due to vanishing gradients, which plague training stability and effectiveness [1][,][18] . Recurrent architectures, a natural alternative for sequential tasks, often suffer from early convergence, rendering subsequent computational steps inert, and rely on the biologically implausible, computationally expensive and memory
intensive Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for training [19] .

The human brain provides a compelling blueprint for achieving the effective computational depth
that contemporary artificial models lack. It organizes computation hierarchically across cortical regions operating at different timescales, enabling deep, multi-stage reasoning [20][,][21][,][22] . Recurrent feedback loops iteratively refine internal representations, allowing slow, higher-level areas to
guide, and fast, lower-level circuits to execute—subordinate processing while preserving global
coherence [23][,][24][,][25] . Notably, the brain achieves such depth without incurring the prohibitive creditassignment costs that typically hamper recurrent networks from backpropagation through time [19][,][26] .

Inspired by this hierarchical and multi-timescale biological architecture, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM is designed to significantly increase the effective computational depth. It features two coupled recurrent modules: a high-level (H) module for abstract,
deliberate reasoning, and a low-level (L) module for fast, detailed computations. This structure

Figure 2: **The necessity of depth for complex reasoning. Left:** On _Sudoku-Extreme Full_, which
require extensive tree-search and backtracking, increasing a Transformer’s width yields no performance gain, while increasing depth is critical. **Right:** Standard architectures saturates, failing to
benefit from increased depth. HRM overcomes this fundamental limitation, effectively using its
computational depth to achieve near-perfect accuracy.

avoids the rapid convergence of standard recurrent models through a process we term “hierarchical convergence.” The slow-updating H-module advances only after the fast-updating L-module
has completed multiple computational steps and reached a local equilibrium, at which point the
L-module is reset to begin a new computational phase.

Furthermore, we propose a one-step gradient approximation for training HRM, which offers improved efficiency and eliminates the requirement for BPTT. This design maintains a constant memory footprint ( _O_ (1) compared to BPTT’s _O_ ( _T_ ) for _T_ timesteps) throughout the backpropagation
process, making it scalable and more biologically plausible.

Leveraging its enhanced effective depth, HRM excels at tasks that demand extensive search and
backtracking. **Using only 1,000 input-output examples, without pre-training or CoT supervi-**
**sion**, HRM learns to solve problems that are intractable for even the most advanced LLMs. For
example, it achieves near-perfect accuracy in complex Sudoku puzzles ( _Sudoku-Extreme Full_ ) and
optimal pathfinding in 30x30 mazes, where state-of-the-art CoT methods completely fail (0% accuracy). In the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) AGI Challenge [27][,][28][,][29] - a benchmark
of inductive reasoning - HRM, trained from scratch with only the official dataset (~1000 examples), with only 27M parameters and a 30x30 grid context (900 tokens), achieves a performance
of **40.3%**, which substantially surpasses leading CoT-based models like o3-mini-high (34.5%)
and Claude 3.7 8K context (21.2%), despite their considerably larger parameter sizes and context lengths, as shown in Figure 1. This represents a promising direction toward the development
of next-generation AI reasoning systems with universal computational capabilities.
### **2 Hierarchical Reasoning Model**

We present the HRM, inspired by three fundamental principles of neural computation observed in
the brain:

- **Hierarchical processing:** The brain processes information across a hierarchy of cortical areas. Higher-level areas integrate information over longer timescales and form abstract representations, while lower-level areas handle more immediate, detailed sensory and motor processing [20][,][22][,][21] .

3

- **Temporal Separation:** These hierarchical levels in the brain operate at distinct intrinsic timescales,
reflected in neural rhythms (e.g., slow theta waves, 4–8 Hz and fast gamma waves, 30–100
Hz) [30][,][31] . This separation allows for stable, high-level guidance of rapid, low-level computations [32][,][33] .

- **Recurrent Connectivity:** The brain features extensive recurrent connections. These feedback
loops enable iterative refinement, yielding more accurate and context-sensitive representations
at the cost of additional processing time. Additionally, the brain largely avoids the problematic
deep credit assignment problem associated with BPTT [19] .

The HRM model consists of four learnable components: an input network _f_ _I_ ( _·_ ; _θ_ _I_ ), a low-level recurrent module _f_ _L_ ( _·_ ; _θ_ _L_ ), a high-level recurrent module _f_ _H_ ( _·_ ; _θ_ _H_ ), and an output network _f_ _O_ ( _·_ ; _θ_ _O_ ).
The model’s dynamics unfold over _N_ high-level cycles of _T_ low-level timesteps each [2] . We index
the total timesteps of one forward pass by _i_ = 1 _, . . ., N × T_ . The modules _f_ _L_ and _f_ _H_ each keep a
hidden state— _z_ _L_ _[i]_ [for] _[ f]_ _[L]_ [ and] _[ z]_ _H_ _[i]_ [for] _[ f]_ _[H]_ [—which are initialized with the vectors] _[ z]_ _L_ [0] [and] _[ z]_ _H_ [0] [, respec-]
tively.

The HRM maps an input vector _x_ to an output prediction vector ˆ _y_ as follows. First, the input _x_ is
projected into a working representation ˜ _x_ by the input network:

˜
_x_ = _f_ _I_ ( _x_ ; _θ_ _I_ ) _._

At each timestep _i_, the L-module updates its state conditioned on its own previous state, the Hmodule’s current state (which remains fixed throughout the cycle), and the input representation.
The H-module only updates once per cycle (i.e., every _T_ timesteps) using the L-module’s final
state at the end of that cycle:

_z_ _L_ _[i]_ [=] _[ f]_ _[L]_ � _z_ _L_ _[i][−]_ [1] _[, z]_ _H_ _[i][−]_ [1] _[,]_ [ ˜] _[x]_ [;] _[ θ]_ _[L]_ � _,_


_z_ _H_ _[i]_ [=]


_f_ _H_ � _z_ _H_ _[i][−]_ [1] _[, z]_ _L_ _[i][−]_ [1] [;] _[ θ]_ _[H]_ � if _i ≡_ 0 (mod _T_ ) _,_
_z_ _[i][−]_ [1] otherwise _._
� _H_


Finally, after _N_ full cycles, a prediction ˆ _y_ is extracted from the hidden state of the H-module:

ˆ
_y_ = _f_ _O_ ( _z_ _H_ _[NT]_ [;] _[ θ]_ _[O]_ [)] _[ .]_

This entire _NT_ -timestep process represents a single forward pass of the HRM. A halting mechanism (detailed later in this section) determines whether the model should terminate, in which case

ˆ
_y_ will be used as the final prediction, or continue with an additional forward pass.

**Hierarchical convergence** Although convergence is crucial for recurrent networks, standard RNNs
are fundamentally limited by their tendency to converge too early. As the hidden state settles toward
a fixed point, update magnitudes shrink, effectively stalling subsequent computation and capping
the network’s effective depth. To preserve computational power, we actually want convergence to
proceed very slowly–but engineering that gradual approach is difficult, since pushing convergence
too far edges the system toward instability.

2 While inspired by temporal separation in the brain, our model’s “high-level” and “low-level” modules are conceptual abstractions and do not map directly to specific neural oscillation frequencies.

Figure 3: Comparison of forward residuals and PCA trajectories. HRM shows hierarchical convergence: the H-module steadily converges, while the L-module repeatedly converges within cycles
before being reset by H, resulting in residual spikes. The recurrent neural network exhibits rapid
convergence with residuals quickly approaching zero. In contrast, the deep neural network experiences vanishing gradients, with significant residuals primarily in the initial (input) and final layers.

HRM is explicitly designed to counteract this premature convergence through a process we term
_hierarchical convergence_ . During each cycle, the L-module (an RNN) exhibits stable convergence
to a _local equilibrium_ . This equilibrium, however, depends on the high-level state _z_ _H_ supplied
during that cycle. After completing the _T_ steps, the H-module incorporates the sub-computation’s
outcome (the final state _z_ _L_ ) and performs its own update. This _z_ _H_ update establishes a fresh context
for the L-module, essentially “restarting” its computational path and initiating a new convergence
phase toward a different local equilibrium.

This process allows the HRM to perform a sequence of distinct, stable, nested computations, where
the H-module directs the overall problem-solving strategy and the L-module executes the intensive
search or refinement required for each step. Although a standard RNN may approach convergence
within _T_ iterations, the hierarchical convergence benefits from an enhanced effective depth of _NT_
steps. As empirically shown in Figure 3, this mechanism allows HRM both to maintain high
computational activity (forward residual) over many steps (in contrast to a standard RNN, whose
activity rapidly decays) and to enjoy stable convergence. This translates into better performance at
any computation depth, as illustrated in Figure 2.

**Approximate gradient** Recurrent models typically use BPTT to compute gradients. However,
BPTT requires storing the hidden states from the forward pass and then combining them with
gradients during the backward pass, which demands _O_ ( _T_ ) memory for T timesteps. This heavy
memory burden forces smaller batch sizes and leads to poor GPU utilization, especially for largescale networks. Additionally, because retaining the full history trace through time is biologically
implausible, it is unlikely that the brain implements BPTT [19] .

Fortunately, if a recurrent neural network converges to a fixed point, we can avoid unrolling its state
sequence by applying backpropagation in a single step at that equilibrium point. Moreover, such a
mechanism could plausibly be implemented in the brain using only local learning rules [34][,][35] . Based

5

on this finding, we propose a one-step approximation of the HRM gradient–using the gradient of
the last state of each module and treating other states as constant. The gradient path is, therefore,

Output head → final state of the H-module → final state of the L-module → input embedding

The above method needs _O_ (1) memory, does not require unrolling through time, and can be easily
implemented with an autograd framework such as PyTorch, as shown in Figure 4. Given that
each module only needs to back-propagate errors through its most recent local synaptic activity,
this approach aligns well with the perspective that cortical credit assignment relies on short-range,
temporally local mechanisms rather than on a global replay of activity patterns.


The one-step gradient approximation is theoretically
grounded in the mathematics of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) [36] which employs the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to bypass BPTT, as detailed next. Consider an
idealized HRM behavior where, during high-level cycle
_k_, the L-module repeatedly updates until its state _z_ _L_ converges to a local fixed point _z_ _L_ _[⋆]_ [. This fixed point, given]
the current high-level state _z_ _H_ _[k][−]_ [1] [, can be expressed as]

_z_ _L_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[ f]_ _[L]_ [(] _[z]_ _L_ _[⋆]_ _[, z]_ _H_ _[k][−]_ [1] _[,]_ [ ˜] _[x]_ [;] _[ θ]_ _[L]_ [)] _[ .]_

The H-module then performs a single update using this
converged L-state:

_z_ _H_ _[k]_ [=] _[ f]_ _[H]_ [(] _[z]_ _H_ _[k][−]_ [1] _[, z]_ _L_ _[⋆]_ [;] _[ θ]_ _[H]_ [)] _[ .]_

With a proper mapping _F_, the updates to the high-level
state can be written in a more compact form as _z_ _H_ _[k]_ [=]
_F_ ( _z_ _H_ _[k][−]_ [1] [; ˜] _[x, θ]_ [)][, where] _[ θ]_ [ = (] _[θ]_ _[I]_ _[, θ]_ _[L]_ [)][, and the fixed-point]
_∂F_
can be written as _z_ _H_ _[⋆]_ [=] _[ F]_ [(] _[z]_ _H_ _[⋆]_ [; ˜] _[x, θ]_ [)][. Let] _[ J]_ _[F]_ [ =] _∂z_ _H_ [be]
the Jacobian of _F_, and assume that the matrix _I −_ _J_ _F_ is
invertible at _z_ _H_ _[⋆]_ [and that the mapping] _[ F]_ [ is continuously]
differentiable. The Implicit Function Theorem then allows us to calculate the exact gradient of fixed point _z_ _H_ _[⋆]_
with respect to the parameters _θ_ without explicit backpropagation:

Calculating the above gradient requires evaluating and inverting matrix ( _I −_ _J_ _F_ ) that can be computationally expensive. Given the Neumann series expansion,

By substituting Equation (3) back into Equation (2), we arrive at the final simplified gradients.

Before defining our loss function, we must first introduce two key elements of our proposed
method: _deep supervision_ and _adaptive computational time_ .

**Deep supervision** Inspired by the principle that periodic neural oscillations regulate when learning
occurs in the brain [38], we incorporate a deep supervision mechanism into HRM, as detailed next.

Given a data sample ( _x, y_ ), we run multiple forward passes of the HRM model, each of which we
refer to as a _segment_ . Let _M_ denote the total number of segments executed before termination.
For each segment _m ∈{_ 1 _, . . ., M_ _}_, let _z_ _[m]_ = ( _z_ _H_ _[mNT]_ _, z_ _L_ _[mNT]_ ) represent the hidden state at the
conclusion of segment _m_, encompassing both high-level and low-level state components.

At each segment _m_, we apply a deep supervision step as follows:

1. Given the state _z_ _[m][−]_ [1] from the previous segment, compute the next state _z_ _[m]_ and its associated
output ˆ _y_ _[m]_ through a forward pass in the HRM model:

( _z_ _[m]_ _,_ ˆ _y_ _[m]_ ) _←_ HRM( _z_ _[m][−]_ [1] _, x_ ; _θ_ )

2. Compute the loss for the current segment:

_L_ _[m]_ _←_ L OSS (ˆ _y_ _[m]_ _, y_ )

3. Update parameters:

_θ ←_ O PTIMIZER S TEP ( _θ, ∇_ _θ_ _L_ _[m]_ )

The crucial aspect of this procedure is that the hidden state _z_ _[m]_ is “detached” from the computation graph before being used as the input state for the next segment. Consequently, gradients from
segment _m_ + 1 do not propagate back through segment _m_, effectively creating a 1-step approximation of the gradient of the recursive deep supervision process [39][,][40] . This approach provides more
frequent feedback to the H-module and serves as a regularization mechanism, demonstrating superior empirical performance and enhanced stability in deep equilibrium models when compared to
more complex, Jacobian-based regularization techniques [39][,][41] . Figure 4 shows pseudocode of deep
supervision training.

**Adaptive computational time (ACT)** The brain dynamically alternates between automatic thinking (“System 1”) and deliberate reasoning (“System 2”) [42] . Neuroscientific evidence shows that
these cognitive modes share overlapping neural circuits, particularly within regions such as the
prefrontal cortex and the default mode network [43][,][44] . This indicates that the brain dynamically modulates the “runtime” of these circuits according to task complexity and potential rewards [45][,][46] .

Inspired by the above mechanism, we incorporate an adaptive halting strategy into HRM that enables “thinking, fast and slow”. This integration leverages deep supervision and uses the Q-learning

7

algorithm [47] to adaptively determine the number of segments. A Q-head uses the final state of the
H-module to predict the Q-values _Q_ [ˆ] _[m]_ = ( _Q_ [ˆ] _[m]_ halt _[,]_ [ ˆ] _[Q]_ continue _[m]_ [)][ of the “halt” and “continue” actions:]

ˆ
_Q_ _[m]_ = _σ_ ( _θ_ _Q_ _[⊤]_ _[z]_ _H_ _[mNT]_ ) _,_

where _σ_ denotes the sigmoid function applied element-wise. The halt or continue action is chosen
using a randomized strategy as detailed next. Let _M_ max denote the maximum number of segments
(a fixed hyperparameter) and _M_ min denote the minimum number of segments (a random variable).
The value of _M_ min is determined stochastically: with probability _ε_, it is sampled uniformly from the
set _{_ 2 _, · · ·, M_ max _}_ (to encourage longer thinking), and with probability 1 _−_ _ε_, it is set to 1. The halt
action is selected under two conditions: when the segment count surpasses the maximum threshold
_M_ max, or when the estimated halt value _Q_ [ˆ] halt exceeds the estimated continue value _Q_ [ˆ] continue and the
segment count has reached at least the minimum threshold _M_ min .

The Q-head is updated through a Q-learning algorithm, which is defined on the following episodic
Markov Decision Process (MDP). The state of the MDP at segment _m_ is _z_ _[m]_, and the action space
is _{_ halt _,_ continue _}_ . Choosing the action “halt” terminates the episode and returns a binary reward

ˆ
indicating prediction correctness, i.e., **1** _{y_ _[m]_ = _y}_ . Choosing “continue” yields a reward of 0 and
the state transitions to _z_ _[m]_ [+1] . Thus, the Q-learning targets for the two actions _G_ [ˆ] _[m]_ = ( _G_ [ˆ] _[m]_ halt _[,]_ [ ˆ] _[G]_ _[m]_ continue [)]
are given by

_G_ ˆ _[m]_ halt [=] **[ 1]** _[{][y]_ [ˆ] _[m]_ [ =] _[ y][}][,]_


_G_ ˆ _[m]_ continue [=]








ˆ
_Q_ _[m]_ halt [+1] _[,]_ if _m ≥_ _N_ max _,_


max( _Q_ [ˆ] _[m]_ halt [+1] _[,]_ [ ˆ] _[Q]_ _[m]_ continue [+1] [)] _[,]_ otherwise _._


We can now define the loss function of our learning procedure. The overall loss for each supervision
segment combines both the Q-head loss and the sequence-to-sequence loss:

_L_ _[m]_ ACT [=][ L] [OSS] [(ˆ] _[y]_ _[m]_ _[, y]_ [) +][ B] [INARY] [C] [ROSS] [E] [NTROPY] [( ˆ] _[Q]_ _[m]_ _[,]_ [ ˆ] _[G]_ _[m]_ [)] _[ .]_

Minimizing the above loss enables both accurate predictions and nearly optimal stopping decisions.

Selecting the “halt” action ends the supervision loop. In practice, sequences are processed in
batches, which can be easily handled by substituting any halted sample in the batch with a fresh
sample from the dataloader.

Figure 5 presents a performance comparison between two HRM variants: one incorporating ACT
and another employing a fixed computational step count equivalent to ACT’s _M_ max parameter. It
shows that ACT effectively adapts its computational resources based on task complexity, achieving
significant computational savings with minimal impact on performance.

**Inference-time scaling** An effective neural model should exploit additional computational resources during inference to enhance performance. As illustrated in Figure 5-(c), HRM seamlessly
achieves inference-time scaling by simply increasing the computational limit parameter, _M_ max
without requiring further training or architectural modifications.

Additional compute is especially effective for tasks that demand deeper reasoning. On Sudoku—
a problem that often requires long-term planning—HRM exhibits strong inference-time scaling.
On the other hand, we find that extra computational resources yield minimal gains in ARC-AGI
challenge, as solutions generally require only a few transformations.

Inference-time scalability. Models trained with a specific _M_ max can generalize to higher computational limits during inference, leading to improved accuracy. For example, a model trained with

**Stability of Q-learning in ACT** The deep Q-learning that underpins our ACT mechanism is
known to be prone to instability, often requiring stabilization techniques such as replay buffers
and target networks [48], which are absent in our design. Our approach, however, achieves stability
through the intrinsic properties of our model and training procedure. Recent theoretical work by
Gallici et al. [49] shows that Q-learning can achieve convergence if network parameters are bounded,
weight decay is incorporated during training, and post-normalization layers are implemented. Our
model satisfies these conditions through its Post-Norm architecture that employs RMSNorm (a
layer normalization variant) and the AdamW optimizer. AdamW has been shown to solve an _L_ _∞_ constrained optimization problem, ensuring that model parameters remain bounded by 1 _/λ_ [50] .

**Architectural details** We employ a sequence-to-sequence architecture for HRM. Both input and
output are represented as token sequences: _x_ = ( _x_ 1 _, . . ., x_ _l_ ) and _y_ = ( _y_ 1 _, . . ., y_ _l_ _′_ ) respectively.
The model includes an embedding layer _f_ _I_ that converts discrete tokens into vector representations, and an output head _f_ _O_ ( _z_ ; _θ_ _O_ ) = softmax( _θ_ _O_ _z_ ) that transforms hidden states into token probability distributions ˆ _y_ . For small-sample experiments, we replace softmax with stablemax [51] to
improve generalization performance. The sequence-to-sequence loss is averaged over all tokens,

_l_ _′_

L OSS (ˆ _y, y_ ) = [1] _[′]_ � _i_ =1 [log] _[ p]_ [(] _[y]_ _[i]_ [)][, where] _[ p]_ [(] _[y]_ _[i]_ [)][ is the probability that distribution][ ˆ] _[y]_ _[i]_ [ assigns to token]


_l_ [1] _[′]_ � _li_ _′_


L OSS (ˆ _y, y_ ) = _l_ [1] _[′]_ � _i_ =1 [log] _[ p]_ [(] _[y]_ _[i]_ [)][, where] _[ p]_ [(] _[y]_ _[i]_ [)][ is the probability that distribution][ ˆ] _[y]_ _[i]_ [ assigns to token]

_y_ _i_ . The initial hidden states _z_ [0] are initialized by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with
standard deviation of 1, truncation of 2, and kept fixed throughout training.

Both the low-level and high-level recurrent modules _f_ _L_ and _f_ _H_ are implemented using encoderonly Transformer [52] blocks with identical architectures and dimensions. These modules take multiple inputs, and we use straightforward element-wise addition to combine them, though more
sophisticated merging techniques such as gating mechanisms could potentially improve performance and is left for future work. For all Transformer blocks in this work—including those in
the baseline models—we incorporate the enhancements found in modern LLMs (based on Llama [53]

architectures). These improvements include Rotary Positional Encoding [54], Gated Linear Units [55],
RMSNorm [56], and the removal of bias terms from linear layers.

Furthermore, both HRM and recurrent Transformer models implement a Post-Norm architecture

with weights initialized via truncated LeCun Normal initialization [57][,][58][,][59], while the scale and bias
parameters are excluded from RMSNorm. All parameters are optimized using the Adam-atan2 optimizer [60], a scale-invariant variant of Adam [61], combined with a constant learning rate that includes
linear warm-up.
### **3 Results**

This section begins by describing the ARC-AGI, Sudoku, and Maze benchmarks, followed by an
overview of the baseline models and their results. Figure 6-(a,b,c) presents a visual representation of the three benchmark tasks, which are selected to evaluate various reasoning abilities in AI
models.
#### **3.1 Benchmarks**

**ARC-AGI Challenge** The ARC-AGI benchmark evaluates general fluid intelligence through IQtest-like puzzles that require inductive reasoning [27] . The initial version, ARC-AGI-1, presents challenges as input-label grid pairs that force AI systems to extract and generalize abstract rules from
just a few examples. Each task provides a few input–output demonstration pairs (usually 2–3) and
a test input. An AI model has two attempts to produce the correct output grid. Although some believe that mastering ARC-AGI would signal true artificial general intelligence, its primary purpose
is to expose the current roadblocks in AGI progress. In fact, both conventional deep learning methods and CoT techniques have faced significant challenges with ARC-AGI-1, primarily because it
requires the ability to generalize to entirely new tasks [28] .

Addressing the limitations identified in ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 significantly expands the benchmark by providing a more comprehensive and carefully refined collection of tasks. These new
tasks emphasize deeper compositional reasoning, multi-step logic, contextual rule application, and
symbolic abstraction. Human calibration studies show these tasks are challenging but doable for
people, while being much harder for current AI systems, offering a clearer measure of general
reasoning abilities [29] .

10

**Sudoku-Extreme** Sudoku is a 9 _×_ 9 logic puzzle, requiring each row, column, and 3 _×_ 3 block to
contain the digits 1–9 exactly once. A prediction is considered correct if it exactly matches the
puzzle’s unique solution. Sudoku’s complex logical structure makes it a popular benchmark for
evaluating logical reasoning in machine learning [62][,][63][,][64] .

The most frequently used Sudoku dataset in research, namely the Kaggle dataset [65], can be fully
solved using elementary single-digit techniques [66] . The minimal 17-clue puzzles [62], another widelyused collection, might seem more challenging due to its small number of clues. However, this
perception is misleading—since 17 represents the minimum number of clues required to guarantee
a unique Sudoku solution, these hints need to be highly orthogonal to each other. This orthogonal
arrangement leads to many direct, easily-resolved solution paths [67] .

We introduce _Sudoku-Extreme_, a more challenging dataset that is compiled from the aforementioned easy datasets as well as puzzles recognized by the Sudoku community as exceptionally
difficult for human players:

- Easy puzzles compiled from Kaggle, 17-clue, plus unbiased samples from the Sudoku puzzle
distribution [67] : totaling 1 149 158 puzzles.

- Challenging puzzles compiled from Magictour 1465, Forum-Hard and Forum-Extreme subsets:
totaling 3 104 157 puzzles.

The compiled data then undergo a strict 90/10 train-test split, ensuring that the test set puzzles
cannot be derived through equivalent transformations of any training samples. _Sudoku-Extreme_ is
a down-sampled subset of this data containing 1000 training examples. We use _Sudoku-Extreme_ in
our main experiments (Figure 1), which focuses on small-sample learning scenarios. To guarantee
convergence and control overfitting effects in our analysis experiments (Figures 2, 3 and 5), we use
the complete training data, _Sudoku-Extreme-Full_, containing 3 831 994 examples.

We measure puzzle difficulty by counting the number of search backtracks (“guesses”) required
by a smart Sudoku solver program _tdoku_, which uses propositional logic to reduce the number of
guesses [67] . Our _Sudoku-Extreme_ dataset exhibits a mean difficulty of 22 backtracks per puzzle, significantly higher than existing datasets, including recent handmade puzzles Sudoku-Bench [68] which
average just 0 _._ 45 backtracks per puzzle. These subset complexity levels are shown in Figure 6-(d).

**Maze-Hard** This task involves finding the optimal path in a 30 _×_ 30 maze, making it interpretable
and frequently used for training LLMs in search tasks [69][,][70][,][71] . We adopt the instance generation
procedure of Lehnert et al. [71], but introduce an additional filter to retain only those instances whose
difficulty exceeds 110. Here, “difficulty” is defined as the length of the shortest path, which aligns
with the linear time complexity of the wavefront breadth-first search algorithm on GPUs [72] . A path
is considered correct if it is valid and optimal—that is, the shortest route from the start to the goal.
The training and test set both include 1000 examples.
#### **3.2 Evaluation Details**

For all benchmarks, HRM models were initialized with random weights and trained in the sequenceto-sequence setup using the input-output pairs. The two-dimensional input and output grids were
flattened and then padded to the maximum sequence length. The resulting performance is shown in
Figure 1. Remarkably, HRM attains these results with just ~1000 training examples per task—and
**without pretraining or CoT labels** .

11

For ARC-AGI challenge, we start with (1) all demonstration and test input-label pairs from the
training set, and (2) all demonstration pairs along with test inputs from the evaluation set. The
dataset is augmented by applying translations, rotations, flips, and color permutations to the puzzles. Each task example is prepended with a learnable special token that represents the puzzle it
belongs to. At test time, we proceed as follows for each test input in the evaluation set: (1) Generate and solve 1000 augmented variants and, for each, apply the inverse-augmentation transform to
obtain a prediction. (2) Choose the two most popular predictions as the final outputs. [3] All reported
results are obtained by comparing the outputs with the withheld test labels from the evaluation set.

We augment Sudoku puzzles by applying band and digit permutations, while data augmentation is
disabled for Maze tasks. Both tasks undergo only a single inference pass.

For ARC-AGI, the scores of the CoT models are taken from the official leaderboard [29], while for
Sudoku and Maze, the scores are obtained by evaluating through the corresponding API.

In Figure 1, the baselines are grouped based on whether they are pre-trained and use CoT, or neither.
The “Direct pred” baseline means using “direct prediction without CoT and pre-training”, which
retains the exact training setup of HRM but swaps in a Transformer architecture. Interestingly, on
ARC-AGI-1, “Direct pred” matches the performance of Liao and Gu [73], who built a carefully designed, domain-specific equivariant network for learning the ARC-AGI task from scratch, without
pre-training. By substituting the Transformer architecture with HRM’s hierarchical framework and
implementing ACT, we achieve more than a twofold performance improvement.

On the _Sudoku-Extreme_ and _Maze-Hard_ benchmarks, the performance gap between HRM and the
baseline methods is significant, as the baselines almost never manage to solve the tasks. These
benchmarks that demand lengthy reasoning traces are particularly difficult for CoT-based methods.
With only 1000 training examples, the “Direct pred” baseline—which employs an 8-layer Transformer identical in size to HRM—fails entirely on these challenging reasoning problems. When
trained on the larger _Sudoku-Extreme-Full_ dataset, however, “Direct pred” can solve some easy
Sudoku puzzles and reaches 16 _._ 9% accuracy (see Figure 2). Lehnert et al. [71] showed that a large
vanilla Transformer model with 175M parameters, trained on 1 million examples across multiple
trials, achieved only marginal success on 30x30 Maze tasks, with accuracy below 20% using the
_pass_ @64 evaluation metric.
#### **3.3 Visualization of intermediate timesteps**

Although HRM demonstrates strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, it raises an intriguing question: what underlying reasoning algorithms does the HRM neural network actually implement? Addressing this question is important for enhancing model interpretability and developing a
deeper understanding of the HRM solution space.

While a definitive answer lies beyond our current scope, we begin our investigation by analyzing
state trajectories and their corresponding solution evolution. More specifically, at each timestep
_i_ and given the low-level and high-level state pair ( _z_ _L_ _[i]_ [and] _[ z]_ _H_ _[i]_ [) we perform a preliminary forward]
pass through the H-module to obtain ¯ _z_ _[i]_ = _f_ _H_ ( _z_ _H_ _[i]_ _[, z]_ _L_ _[i]_ [;] _[ θ]_ _[H]_ [)][ and its corresponding decoded prediction]
_y_ ¯ _[i]_ = _f_ _O_ (¯ _z_ _[i]_ ; _θ_ _O_ ). The prediction ¯ _y_ _[i]_ is then visualized in Figure 7.

In the Maze task, HRM appears to initially explore several potential paths simultaneously, subsequently eliminating blocked or inefficient routes, then constructing a preliminary solution outline

3 The ARC-AGI allows two attempts for each test input.

followed by multiple refinement iterations. In Sudoku, the strategy resembles a depth-first search
approach, where the model appears to explore potential solutions and backtracks when it hits dead
ends. HRM uses a different approach for ARC tasks, making incremental adjustments to the board
and iteratively improving it until reaching a solution. Unlike Sudoku, which involves frequent
backtracking, the ARC solution path follows a more consistent progression similar to hill-climbing
optimization.

Importantly, the model shows that it can adapt to different reasoning approaches, likely choosing an
effective strategy for each particular task. Further research is needed to gain more comprehensive
insights into these solution strategies.
### **4 Brain Correspondence**

A key principle from systems neuroscience is that a brain region’s functional repertoire—its ability
to handle diverse and complex tasks—is closely linked to the dimensionality of its neural representations [75][,][76] . Higher-order cortical areas, responsible for complex reasoning and decision-making,
must handle a wide variety of tasks, demanding more flexible and context-dependent processing [77] .
In dynamical systems, this flexibility is often realized through higher-dimensional state-space trajectories, which allow for a richer repertoire of potential computations [78] . This principle gives rise
to an observable _dimensionality hierarchy_, where a region’s position in the processing hierarchy

**HRM.** (c) PR scaling of the trained HRM with task diversity. The dimensionality of the highlevel module ( _z_ _H_ ) scales with the number of unique tasks (trajectories) included in the analysis,

( _z_ _L_ ) dimensionality remains stable. (d) PR values for the low-level ( _z_ _L_, PR = 30.22) and highlevel ( _z_ _H_, PR = 89.95) modules of the _trained_ HRM, computed from neural activity during 100

**Network.** To verify that the dimensionality hierarchy is an emergent property of training, the same
analyses were performed on an _untrained_ HRM with random weights. (e) In contrast to the trained
model’s scaling in (c), the dimensionality of both modules in the untrained model remains low and
stable, failing to scale with the number of tasks. (f) Similarly, contrasting with the clear separation
in (d), the PR values for the untrained model’s modules ( _z_ _L_, PR = 42.09; _z_ _H_, PR = 40.75) are
low and nearly identical, showing no evidence of hierarchical separation. This confirms that the
observed hierarchical organization of dimensionality is a learned property that emerges through
training, not an artifact of the model’s architecture.

14

correlates with its _effective dimensionality_ . To quantify this phenomenon, we can examine the
Participation Ratio (PR), which serves as a standard measure of the effective dimensionality of a
high-dimensional representation [79] . The PR is calculated using the formula



[�] _i_ _[λ]_ _[i]_ [)] [2]

� _i_ _[λ]_ _i_ [2]


PR = [(][�]


_,_
_i_ _[λ]_ _i_ [2]


where _{λ_ _i_ _}_ are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of neural trajectories. Intuitively, a higher
PR value signifies that variance is distributed more evenly across many dimensions, corresponding
to a higher-dimensional representation. Conversely, a lower PR value indicates that variance is
concentrated in only a few principal components, reflecting a more compact, lower-dimensional

structure.

The dimensionality hierarchy can be observed, for example, in the mouse cortex, where the PR of
population activity increases monotonically from low-level sensory areas to high-level associative
areas, supporting this link between dimensionality and functional complexity [74] (Figure 8 (a,b)).

We evaluated whether HRM reproduces this neuroscientific principle by calculating the PR for
both recurrent modules after training on the _Sudoku-Extreme Full_ dataset. The PR computation
used the covariance matrix derived from neural states gathered across multiple Sudoku-solving
trajectories. The results show a striking parallel to the biological findings. The low-level module’s
state ( _z_ _L_ ) occupies a relatively small subspace with a participation ratio of 30.22, whereas the highlevel module’s state ( _z_ _H_ ) operates in a substantially larger subspace with a participation ratio of
89.95, as shown in Figure 8(c). Furthermore, Figure 8(d) shows that increasing the number of
unique tasks (trajectories) from 10 to 100 causes _z_ _H_ dimensionality to scale up accordingly, while
_z_ _L_ dimensionality remains stable. These results suggest an _emergent_ separation of representational
capacity between the modules that parallels their functional roles.

To confirm that this hierarchical organization is an emergent property of training, and not an artifact
of the network’s architecture, we performed a control analysis using an identical but untrained
network with random weights.

We initialized an identical HRM architecture with random weights and, without any training, measured the PR of its modules as the network processed the same task-specific inputs given to the
trained model.

The results, shown in Figure 8(e,f), reveal a stark contrast: the high-level and low-level modules of
the untrained network exhibit no hierarchical separation, with their PR values remaining low and
nearly indistinguishable from each other. This control analysis validates that the dimensionality
hierarchy is an _emergent property_ that arises as the model learns to perform complex reasoning.

The high-to-low PR ratio in HRM ( _z_ _H_ _/z_ _L_ _≈_ 2 _._ 98) closely matches that measured in the mouse
cortex ( _≈_ 2 _._ 25). In contrast, conventional deep networks often exhibit _neural collapse_, where
last-layer features converge to a low-dimensional subspace [80][,][81][,][82] . HRM therefore departs from the
collapse pattern and instead fosters a high-dimensional representation in its higher module. This
is significant because such representations are considered crucial for cognitive flexibility and are a
hallmark of higher-order brain regions like the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is central to complex
reasoning.

This structural parallel suggests the model has discovered a fundamental organizational principle.
By learning to partition its representations into a high-capacity, high-dimensional subspace ( _z_ _H_ )

15

and a more specialized, low-dimensional one ( _z_ _L_ ), HRM autonomously discovers an organizational
principle that is thought to be fundamental for achieving robust and flexible reasoning in biological
systems. This provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the model’s success on complex,
long-horizon tasks that are intractable for models lacking such a differentiated internal structure.
We emphasize, however, that this evidence is correlational. While a causal link could be tested
via intervention (e.g., by constraining the H-module’s dimensionality), such methods are difficult
to interpret in deep learning due to potential confounding effects on the training process itself.
Thus, the causal necessity of this emergent hierarchy remains an important question for future
investigation.
### **5 Related Work**

**Reasoning and algorithm learning** Given the central role of reasoning problems and their close
relation to algorithms, researchers have long explored neural architectures that enable algorithm
learning from training instances. This line of work includes Neural Turing Machines (NTM) [83],
the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) [84], and Neural GPUs [85] –all of which construct iterative
neural architectures that mimic computational hardware for algorithm execution, and are trained to
learn algorithms from data. Another notable work in this area is Recurrent Relational Networks
(RRN) [62], which executes algorithms on graph representations through graph neural networks.

Recent studies have integrated algorithm learning approaches with Transformer-based architectures. Universal Transformers extend the standard Transformer model by introducing a recurrent
loop over the layers and implementing an adaptive halting mechanism. Geiping et al. [86] demonstrate
that looped Transformers can generalize to a larger number of recurrent steps during inference than
what they were trained on. Shen et al. [16] propose adding continuous recurrent reasoning tokens
to the Transformer. Finally, TransNAR [8] combine recurrent graph neural networks with language
models.

Building on the success of CoT-based reasoning, a line of work have introduced fine-tuning methods that use reasoning paths from search algorithms (like A*) as SFT targets [87][,][71][,][70] .

We also mention adaptive halting mechanisms designed to allocate additional computational resources to more challenging problems. This includes the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for
RNNs [88] and follow-up research like PonderNet [89], which aims to improve the stability of this allocation process.

HRM further pushes the boundary of algorithm learning through a brain-inspired computational
architecture that achieves exceptional data efficiency and model expressiveness, successfully discovering complex and diverse algorithms from just 1000 training examples.

**Brain-inspired reasoning architectures** Developing a model with the reasoning power of the
brain has long been a goal in brain-inspired computing. Spaun [90] is one notable example, which uses
spiking neural networks to create distinct modules corresponding to brain regions like the visual
cortex and prefrontal cortex. This design enables an architecture to perform a range of cognitive
tasks, from memory recall to simple reasoning puzzles. However, its reasoning relies on handdesigned algorithms, which may limit its ability to learn new tasks. Another significant model is the
Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM) [91], which is inspired by the hippocampal-entorhinal system’s
role in spatial and relational memory tasks. TEM proposes that medial entorhinal cells create a
basis for structural knowledge, while hippocampal cells link this basis to sensory information. This

16

allows TEM to generalize and explains the emergence of various cell types like grid, border, and
place cells. Another approach involves neural sampling models [92], which view the neural signaling
process as inference over a distribution, functioning similarly to a Boltzmann machine. These
models often require hand-made rules to be set up for solving a specific reasoning task. In essence,
while prior models are restricted to simple reasoning problems, HRM is designed to solve complex
tasks that are hard for even advanced LLMs, without pre-training or task-specific manual design.

**Hierarchical memory** The hierarchical multi-timescale structure also plays an important role in
how the brain processes memory. Models such as Hierarchical Sequential Models [93] and Clockwork
RNN [94] use multiple recurrent modules that operate at varying time scales to more effectively capture long-range dependencies within sequences, thereby mitigating the forgetting issue in RNNs.

Similar mechanisms have also been adopted in linear attention methods for memorizing long contexts (see the Discussions section). Since HRM focuses on reasoning, full attention is applied for
simplicity. Incorporating hierarchical memory into HRM could be a promising future direction.
### **6 Discussions**

**Turing-completeness of HRM** Like earlier neural reasoning algorithms including the Universal
Transformer [95], HRM is computationally universal when given sufficient memory and time constraints. In other words, it falls into the category of models that can simulate any Turing machine,
overcoming the computational limitations of standard Transformers discussed previously in the introduction. Given that earlier neural algorithm reasoners were trained as recurrent neural networks,
they suffer from premature convergence and memory intensive BPTT. Therefore, in practice, their
effective computational depth remains limited, though still deeper than that of a standard Transformer. By resolving these two challenges and being equipped with adaptive computation, HRM
could be trained on long reasoning processes, solve complex puzzles requiring intensive depth-first
search and backtracking, and move closer to practical Turing-completeness.

**Reinforcement learning with chain-of-thought** Beyond fine-tuning using human-annotated CoT,
reinforcement learning (RL) represents another widely adopted training methodology. However,
recent evidence suggests that RL primarily unlocks existing CoT-like capabilities rather than discovering fundamentally new reasoning mechanisms [96][,][97][,][98][,][99] . Additionally, CoT-training with RL
is known for its instability and data inefficiency, often requiring extensive exploration and careful
reward design. In contrast, HRM takes feedback from dense gradient-based supervision rather than
relying on a sparse reward signal. Moreover, HRM operates naturally in a continuous space, which
is biologically plausible and avoids allocating same computational resources to each token, even
though tokens vary in their reasoning and planning complexity [16] .

**Linear attention** Recurrence has been explored not only for its capability in universal computation, but also as a means to replace the attention mechanism in Transformers, which suffers from
quadratic time and memory complexity [100] . Recurrent alternatives offer a more efficient design by
processing input tokens sequentially and predicting the next token at each time step, similar to early
RNN-based language models.

Some linear-attention variants, such as Log-linear Attention [101], share an RNN-like state-update that
can be interpreted as propagating multi-timescale summary statistics, thereby retaining long-range
context without the quadratic memory growth of standard self-attention. However, substituting the
attention mechanism alone does not change the fact that Transformers are still fixed-depth, and

17

require CoT as a compensatory mechanism. Notably, linear attention can operate with a reduced
key-value cache over extended contexts, making them more suitable for deployment on resourceconstrained edge devices.
### **7 Conclusion**

This work introduces the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, a brain-inspired architecture that leverages hierarchical structure and multi-timescale processing to achieve substantial computational
depth without sacrificing training stability or efficiency. With only 27M parameters and training on just 1000 examples, HRM effectively solves challenging reasoning problems such as ARC,
Sudoku, and complex maze navigation–tasks that typically pose significant difficulties for contemporary LLM and chain-of-thought models.

Although the brain relies heavily on hierarchical structures to enable most cognitive processes,
these concepts have largely remained confined to academic literature rather than being translated
into practical applications. The prevailing AI approach continues to favor non-hierarchical models.
Our results challenge this established paradigm and suggest that the Hierarchical Reasoning Model
represents a viable alternative to the currently dominant chain-of-thought reasoning methods, advancing toward a foundational framework capable of Turing-complete universal computation.
