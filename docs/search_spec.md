# Search Module Specification

This specification outlines expected behaviors for the
`autoresearch.search` module.

## Query Generation
- `Search.generate_queries` normalizes raw user text and returns a list of
  variants for external lookup.
- When `return_embeddings=True` it yields deterministic numeric embeddings of
  the cleaned query.

## Backend Selection
- `Search.external_lookup` uses `config.search.backends` to determine which
  registered backends to call.
- Results from each backend are cached via `SearchCache` using the query and
  backend name.
- Cached results must be reused on subsequent lookups without invoking the
  backend again.

## DomainAuthorityScore Ranking
- Credibility ranking relies on `DomainAuthorityScore` entries that map
  domains to scores in `[0,1]`. See the source credibility heuristics in the
  inspirational documents.
- `Search.assess_source_credibility` assigns the configured score for known
  domains and a default of `0.5` otherwise.
- Final result ordering uses a convex combination of BM25, semantic
  similarity and domain authority scores. Results from different
  backends are first scored individually and then merged and re-ranked
  with the same weights to ensure consistent ordering across sources.
  Each component score is normalized to the `0`â€“`1` range before
  weighting. The combined score is computed as:

  ```
  normalize(w_bm25 * bm25 + w_sem * semantic + w_cred * credibility)
  ```

  where the weights are non-negative and renormalized to sum to one
  after disabling any component. Semantic similarities from
  transformers and DuckDB vectors are averaged after normalization so
  hybrid and pure semantic searches operate on the same scale. Combined
  scores are normalized again and sorted in descending order. The math
  is implemented in `src/autoresearch/search/ranking_formula.py`.
  Simulation trials in `ranking_convergence.py` report a mean
  convergence step of `1`, confirming the idempotent ranking.

## Semantic tree traversal

The [system architecture diagram](diagrams/system_architecture.puml)
shows how `Search` collaborates with the `TraversalAgent` and
`SemanticTreeBuilder` to expand semantic trees while persisting branch
scores in the `PathRelevanceStore`. Storage flows in
`docs/diagrams/storage.puml` detail how the semantic hierarchy feeds the
vector indexes. Implementations must keep these links intact so
`Search.external_lookup` can fuse calibrated path relevance with vector
matches during ranking.

## Vector extension fallback

- The DuckDB VSS extension is optional. `VSSExtensionLoader` installs it from
  the network and falls back to a stub at `extensions/vss/vss.duckdb_extension`
  when downloads fail. `download_duckdb_extensions.py` reuses a path stored in
  `.env.offline` (`VECTOR_EXTENSION_PATH`) or creates the stub so storage
  initialization can continue. See
  [duckdb_vss_fallback.md](duckdb_vss_fallback.md) for details.

## Tests
Property-based tests in `tests/unit/test_relevance_ranking.py` verify:
- Results are returned in non-increasing order of `relevance_score`.
- Cached lookups avoid redundant backend calls while preserving ranking.
- Raising any component score increases the final `relevance_score`.
- Changing relevance weights alters ordering to reflect their emphasis.
