# v0.1.0a1 preflight readiness plan (2025-10-05 16:05 UTC)

This revision applies a multi-disciplinary, dialectical, and Socratic
analysis to the current alpha release posture. It replaces the superseded
October 5 snapshot and focuses on the freshest evidence gathered during the
October 4 triage cycle.

## Evidence snapshot

- `uv run mypy --strict src tests` at **16:05 UTC on October 5, 2025** reports
  “Success: no issues found in 205 source files”, keeping the strict gate
  green for alpha triage.【daf290†L1-L2】
- A focused `pytest` target confirms the AUTO mode regression
  (`tests/unit/orchestration/test_auto_mode.py::
  test_auto_mode_returns_direct_answer_when_gate_exits`)
  fails because AUTO mode drops the synthesiser’s claim list, leaving scout
  samples without content; we halted the broad test run after verifying this
  regression to avoid cascading failures.【349e1c†L1-L64】【c59d05†L1-L7】
- Hypothesis aborts
  `tests/unit/test_cache.py::test_legacy_cache_entries_upgrade_on_hit` with a
  function-scoped `monkeypatch` fixture, showing the cache property suite still
  needs deterministic state isolation before we can trust its coverage.
  【bebacc†L5-L21】
- Fallback placeholders now carry canonical URLs and backend labels via
  `Search._normalise_backend_documents`; `task verify` reaches those assertions
  before the known `test_parallel_merging_is_deterministic` failure recurs,
  confirming search metadata fixes held through the latest sweep.
  【F:src/autoresearch/search/core.py†L842-L918】
  【F:tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py†L134-L215】
  【F:tests/unit/test_failure_scenarios.py†L43-L86】
  【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251005T012754Z.log†L1-L196】
- Property-based cache probes still show repeated backend calls on cache hits,
  and behaviour tests record warning banners inside final answers, so the
  previously prioritised regression clusters remain valid targets for the next
  set of PR slices.【5f96a8†L12-L36】【e865e9†L1-L58】【cf191d†L27-L46】

## Dialectical review of active blockers

### Search backend determinism
- **Assumption:** Restoring deterministic request payloads and backend
  signatures will unblock the majority of search failures.
- **Support:** The DuckDuckGo mock rejects the call because the request
  query preserves question punctuation, and the hybrid ranker now invokes
  a patched helper with the wrong arity.【34ebc5†L17-L70】
- **Counterpoint:** Normalising payloads without reviewing cache keys could
  cause hard-to-diagnose mismatches in production telemetry.
- **Synthesis:** Ship a focused PR that (1) reintroduces query canonical
  forms for stubs, (2) restores the cross-backend rank signature and
  adapter hooks, and (3) refreshes unit fixtures to assert both the raw and
  canonical query values.

#### Stub contract
- `ExternalLookupResult` now surfaces `raw_query`, `executed_query`, and
  canonical forms so caches, telemetry, and stubs observe consistent
  payloads.
- Hybrid enrichment pushes query metadata onto the diagnostic stack,
  ensuring `add_embeddings` captures retrieval and fallback phases with
  matching canonical queries.
- Refreshed fixtures cover DuckDuckGo and local file regressions while
  asserting the raw-versus-canonical contract for both stub paths.

### Search cache semantics
- **Assumption:** Cache regressions stem from bypassing namespace-aware keys
  when embeddings or storage shims are active.
- **Support:** The property-based cache test records three backend calls for
  an identical query, proving cache misses despite persisted artifacts.
  【e865e9†L15-L52】
- **Counterpoint:** Suppressing Hypothesis health checks would hide state
  leakage between draws; we need deterministic fixtures before tightening
  cache semantics.【bebacc†L5-L21】
- **Socratic check:** What evidence would show cache keys are fixed while
  Hypothesis still fails? Only a targeted property probe that mutates the
  namespace per draw without relying on `monkeypatch` would separate fixture
  scope from key logic.
- **Synthesis:** Build a namespace + embedding signature helper, replace the
  function-scoped `monkeypatch` fixture with an inline context manager, and
  extend property tests to alternate between cached and uncached namespaces.

### Output formatting fidelity
- **Assumption:** OutputFormatter must preserve control characters and
  whitespace to avoid silently corrupting responses.
- **Support:** Hypothesis finds failing cases where control characters are
  dropped from markdown output and where answers collapse to empty strings
  in JSON.【5f96a8†L12-L36】
- **Counterpoint:** Blindly echoing unescaped control characters could break
  downstream renderers or leak unsafe data.
- **Synthesis:** Encode a conservative escaping strategy that preserves
  byte fidelity in JSON while sanitising markdown through explicit code
  fencing, and add property tests that interrogate the escaping rules.

### Orchestrator determinism and telemetry
- **Assumption:** Deterministic orchestration is critical for reproducible
  audits and accurate behaviour coverage.
- **Support:** The parallel merge test now raises `TypeError` because
  reasoning steps contain dicts instead of strings, and the benchmarking
  harness fails its throughput floor.【53776f†L22-L34】【53776f†L34-L44】
- **Fresh evidence:** AUTO mode’s early exit no longer hydrates scout claim
  payloads, so behaviour telemetry lacks the structured content the API
  contract promises.【349e1c†L1-L64】
- **Counterpoint:** Tightening determinism without tracing why dicts leak
  into reasoning could hide deeper regressions in agent outputs.
- **Socratic probe:** Which invariant must hold for AUTO mode samples to stay
  truthful? Every sample should expose both the textual answer and the claim
  metadata recorded by the synthesiser; a failing invariant highlights the
  missing persistence hook.
- **Synthesis:** Patch the merge reducer to normalise reasoning payloads,
  hydrate AUTO mode samples with persisted claims, audit the aggregator
  contract with Socratic prompts in tests, and recalibrate the scheduler
  benchmark using recorded baseline metrics rather than hard-coded floors.

### AUTO mode sample hydration
- **Assumption:** Rehydrating the synthesiser’s claims into AUTO mode telemetry
  will unblock both the failing unit test and downstream behaviour checks.
- **Support:** The failing unit test shows that samples currently hold empty
  claim lists even when the synthesiser reports claims through telemetry.
  【349e1c†L1-L64】
- **Counterpoint:** Blindly copying claims may reintroduce the dict leakage that
  broke the parallel merge invariant, so we must constrain the format.
- **Socratic check:** What question reveals whether claim normalisation is safe?
  “Which minimal schema lets behaviour consumers assert claim content without
  mutating orchestrator state?” The answer points to mapping-based snapshots
  independent of live objects.
- **Synthesis:** Introduce a claim snapshot helper that converts synthesiser
  claims into serialisable dataclasses, feed those snapshots into AUTO mode
  metrics, and extend behaviour coverage to assert the schema stays stable.

### Reasoning telemetry hygiene
- **Assumption:** Chain-of-thought answers should remain verbatim, with
  warnings exposed separately.
- **Support:** The reasoning modes test now sees warning banners appended to
  the final answer, violating the documented API contract.【cf191d†L27-L46】
- **Counterpoint:** Removing warnings entirely could reduce user awareness
  of audit gaps.
- **Synthesis:** Move warning banners into structured telemetry fields,
  leaving the textual answer untouched while updating behaviour coverage to
  verify both the banner presence and the unmodified answer string.

## Proposed PR slices

Each slice is scoped to minimise turnaround while applying the dialectical
conclusions above.

1. **PR-S1 Search stub normalisation**
   - Canonicalise outbound queries, restore cross-backend rank signatures,
     and add regression tests for DuckDuckGo, hybrid ranking, and local file
     fallbacks.
   - Update cache fixtures to verify canonical and raw query logging.
2. **PR-S2 Cache namespace guards**
   - Introduce a dedicated cache key builder that incorporates embedding and
     storage hints, backfill docstrings, and expand property-based tests to
     interrogate sequential cache hits.
   - Replace function-scoped fixtures in property tests with inline context
     managers to satisfy Hypothesis health checks.【bebacc†L5-L21】
3. **PR-R0 AUTO mode claim hydration**
   - Snapshot synthesiser claims into telemetry-friendly dictionaries,
     hydrate AUTO mode samples with the snapshots, and add regression tests
     that probe for non-empty claim lists.【349e1c†L1-L64】
4. **PR-O1 Output formatter fidelity**
   - Implement JSON whitespace preservation, markdown escaping, and add
     Hypothesis strategies for control characters and whitespace-only
     answers.
5. **PR-R1 Reasoning telemetry separation**
   - Decouple warning banners from answer strings, expose structured
     warnings, and extend behaviour tests to assert clean answers plus
     telemetry fields.
6. **PR-P1 Orchestrator determinism + scheduler benchmarks**
   - Normalise reasoning payloads before merging, record throughput baselines
     in fixtures, and tune benchmark expectations using captured metrics.

A follow-up PR sweep (PR-S3) can concentrate on hybrid embedding cache reuse
once S1 and S2 land, while PR-O2 can add documentation updates for formatter
contracts after O1 merges. TestPyPI remains out of scope until these slices
restore a green suite.

## Behaviour and coverage strategy

- Re-run the full behaviour suite after PR-S1 and PR-R1 merge to confirm
  user workflows still capture unmodified answers and warning telemetry.
- Maintain coverage ≥90 % by extending property-based suites with the new
  fixtures introduced above. The search cache property test already seeds a
  coverage gap we will close once the namespace helper lands.【e865e9†L15-L52】
- Document each regression fix in `STATUS.md`, `TASK_PROGRESS.md`, and the
  alpha issue so future reviewers can trace evidence without relying on the
  superseded October 5 logs.
