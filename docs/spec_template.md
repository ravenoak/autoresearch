# Specification Template

Use this template to describe a module's behavior and rationale.

## Overview

Summarize the module's purpose, scope, and key interactions.

## Algorithms

- Outline core algorithms and data flows.
- Highlight assumptions and decision points.

## Invariants

- Record conditions that must always hold.
- Note constraints on inputs, state, or outputs.

## Proof Sketch

Justify why the algorithms uphold the invariants. Focus on reasoning rather
than formal proofs.

## Simulation Expectations

Describe how to simulate or test the algorithms. Define scenarios, metrics,
and any stochastic elements.

## Traceability

Link to implementation modules and related tests using relative paths.
