# v0.1.0a1 Execution PR Plan

- **Context:** prepare for the v0.1.0a1 tag once prerequisite PRs (L0, L1,
  R1, P1, O1) merge.
- **Goal:** deliver verification evidence, coverage artefacts, refreshed
  documentation, and follow-on tickets.

## PR-1: Verification Baseline

- **Objective:** run the full verification suite and capture artefacts.
- **Scope:**
  - Execute `uv run task verify` with default extras once PR-L0/L1/R1/P1/O1
    merge.
  - Ensure the command completes lint, `mypy --strict`, `pytest`, and the
    behaviour suites without failure.
  - Capture console output to `baseline/logs/verify_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.log`
    (system time in UTC).
  - Summarise key results in `baseline/logs/README.md` if needed.
- **Deliverables:** new log file, optional README note, verification summary in
  the PR description.
- **Parallelism:** can start once the prerequisite PRs land; independent of
  PR-2.
- **Risks & Mitigations:**
  - If the task fails, triage failing suites and flag regressions before
    proceeding to coverage.

## PR-2: Coverage Confirmation

- **Objective:** achieve at least 90 percent coverage and archive reports.
- **Scope:**
  - Run `uv run task coverage` with required extras only (omit GPU unless a
    test explicitly requires it).
  - Validate the resulting coverage percentage is â‰¥90 percent.
  - Save the generated XML and HTML outputs plus the execution log inside the
    release dossier under `baseline/logs/` (e.g.,
    `baseline/logs/coverage_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.{log,xml,html}`).
    Reference the upstream directory if the task emits files elsewhere.
  - Note any slow or flaky tests in the PR discussion.
- **Dependencies:** begins after PR-1 finishes successfully to reuse the
  verified environment.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** if coverage <90 percent, identify missing areas and
  create tasks before continuing.

## PR-3: Documentation Refresh

- **Objective:** update planning artefacts with the executed commands and
  outcomes.
- **Scope:**
  - Revise `docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md`, `CODE_COMPLETE_PLAN.md`, and
    `STATUS.md` with the new timestamps, executed commands, results, and
    pointers to archived artefacts.
  - Ensure references use relative paths and include the verification and
    coverage log filenames.
  - Update any linked issue trackers or checklists noted in the documents.
- **Dependencies:** requires completion of PR-1 and PR-2 because it cites their
  artefacts and timestamps.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** check line wrapping and formatting to satisfy doc
  linting rules; double-check dates against system time.

## PR-4: Gap Tracking Tickets

- **Objective:** record follow-on work before proposing the v0.1.0a1 tag.
- **Scope:**
  - Review the outputs from PR-1 to PR-3 for new gaps (test failures,
    coverage deficits, documentation issues).
  - Create or update issue files in `issues/` with findings, referencing log
    files and remediation owners.
  - Cross-link tickets from `STATUS.md` if applicable.
- **Dependencies:** runs after PR-3 because documentation may reveal
  outstanding actions.
- **Parallelism:** none; relies on prior PR outputs.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** ensure ticket slugs follow naming conventions and
  include actionable next steps.

## Parallel Execution Summary

- PR-1 and PR-2 cannot overlap due to dependency on the verified environment.
- PR-3 depends on artefacts from PR-1 and PR-2.
- PR-4 depends on the consolidated documentation in PR-3.
- Allocate buffer time between PRs for triage if suites fail or coverage dips
  below the target threshold.

## Next Steps

- Monitor upstream merges for PR-L0/L1/R1/P1/O1.
- Prepare automation scripts to capture logs and copy artefacts into
  `baseline/logs/` consistently.
- Draft issue templates for potential follow-on tickets so PR-4 executes
  quickly.
