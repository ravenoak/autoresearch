# Storage Backup

## Overview

Storage backup and restore functionality for the Autoresearch project.

## Algorithms

- Implement core behaviors described above.

## Invariants

- Preserve documented state across operations.

## Proof Sketch

Core routines enforce invariants by validating inputs and state.

## Simulation Expectations

Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases for these routines.
