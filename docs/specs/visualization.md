# Visualization

## Overview

Utilities for generating graphical representations of query results.

## Algorithms

- [Graph Visualization Pipeline](../algorithms/visualization.md)

## Invariants

- Preserve documented state across operations.

## Proof Sketch

Core routines enforce invariants by validating inputs and state.

## Simulation Expectations

Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases for these routines.
