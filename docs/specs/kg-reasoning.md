# Kg Reasoning

## Overview

Helper utilities for ontology reasoning and advanced SPARQL queries.

## Algorithms

- Implement core behaviors described above.

## Invariants

- Preserve documented state across operations.

## Proof Sketch

Core routines enforce invariants by validating inputs and state.

## Simulation Expectations

Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases for these routines.

## Traceability
