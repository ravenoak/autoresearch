# Metrics

## Overview

Token usage tracking and budget adaptation helpers. See the [token budgeting
algorithm](../algorithms/token_budgeting.md) for update rules.

## Algorithms

- Implement core behaviors described above.

## Invariants

- Preserve documented state across operations.

## Proof Sketch

Core routines enforce invariants by validating inputs and state.

## Simulation Expectations

Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases for these routines.
