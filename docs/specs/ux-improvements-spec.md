# UX Improvements Specification

## Overview

This specification aligns the Autoresearch UX roadmap with the milestones in
the [PySide6 Migration and Streamlit Removal Plan][pyside6-plan].
Each phase reuses the migration plan's structure while reframing the goals
around user experience outcomes for the desktop interface. The document
prioritizes dialectical analysis (evaluating trade-offs between PySide6 and
Streamlit) and Socratic inquiry (posing guiding questions for each phase) to
steer the team toward sustainable improvements.

## Algorithms

The UX improvement system implements several key algorithms:

- **Progressive Disclosure Algorithm**: Dynamically adjusts interface complexity based on user expertise and task context
- **Accessibility Compliance Checker**: Automated validation against WCAG 2.1 AA standards with real-time feedback
- **Multi-window State Synchronization**: Conflict-free replicated state management across desktop windows
- **Performance Impact Assessment**: User experience impact modeling for feature changes

## Invariants

- **Accessibility Compliance**: All interface changes must maintain or improve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information hierarchy must be preserved across complexity levels
- **State Consistency**: Multi-window state must remain synchronized within 100ms
- **Performance Bounds**: UX changes must not increase response time by more than 50ms

## Proof Sketch

The UX improvements maintain quality through:
1. Automated accessibility testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline
2. Progressive disclosure validation via user journey mapping
3. Multi-window consistency verification through state synchronization tests
4. Performance regression detection via automated benchmarking

## Simulation Expectations

The UX system must handle:
- High-frequency interaction scenarios (researcher workflows)
- Accessibility testing scenarios (screen reader compatibility)
- Multi-window collaboration scenarios (team research sessions)
- Performance stress testing (large dataset visualization)

## Traceability

- **Interface Components**: `src/autoresearch/ui/desktop/`
- **Accessibility Testing**: `tests/ui/test_accessibility_compliance.py`
- **Progressive Disclosure**: `src/autoresearch/ui/progressive_disclosure.py`
- **Performance Monitoring**: `src/autoresearch/ui/performance_monitor.py`

## Guiding Principles

- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually while preserving
  expert depth for advanced users.
- **Accessibility parity**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance established in the
  Streamlit interface and extend it through Qt-native affordances.
- **Multi-window fluency**: Provide synchronized workspaces that respect
  desktop conventions and the needs of power users.
- **Traceable validation**: Ensure that every UX story maps to PySide6
  components and automated tests.

## Personas Aligned to Migration Phases

- **Rapid Explorer (Phase 1 focus)**: Researchers who need a lightweight
  desktop entry point mirroring the existing Streamlit workflows.
- **Configuration Curator (Phase 2 focus)**: Operators managing complex
  pipelines who require parity with Streamlit features and confidence in
  accessibility support.
- **Insights Strategist (Phase 3 focus)**: Power users comparing multiple
  investigations, expecting multi-window orchestration and advanced
  visualizations.
- **Quality Steward (Phase 4 focus)**: QA and release engineers verifying
  cross-platform, accessibility, and performance requirements.
- **Change Champion (Phase 5 focus)**: Documentation authors and customer
  success leads guiding users through the transition away from Streamlit.

## Phased UX Roadmap

### Phase 1: PySide6 POC Implementation (2 weeks)

- **Guiding question**: Does the native desktop entry point preserve the
  essential UX affordances from Streamlit's MVP?
- **Primary personas**: Rapid Explorer, Configuration Curator (baseline)
- **Key UX stories**:
  - As a Rapid Explorer, I can enter a query, submit it, and review results in
    a single window without regressions from Streamlit.
  - As a Configuration Curator, I can adjust core runtime parameters using
    accessible controls with keyboard navigation.
- **Shared reference**: Use the
  [Phase 1 wireframes](../diagrams/pyside6_layout.md#visual-references) to
  verify layout, feedback, and gating details during story kick-offs.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Functional parity demo covering query submission and results display.
  - Keyboard-only interaction path validated through exploratory testing.
  - Initial accessibility audit documenting color contrast and focus order
    deltas.
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - **Entry**: `QMainWindow` shell with `QLineEdit` query input and `QPushButton`
    submit control render without runtime warnings and mirror Streamlit field
    defaults.
  - **Exit**: `QTableView` results widget displays mocked search responses, and
    `QStatusBar` exposes submission/processing states observable through Qt
    debug logs.
  - **Observability**: Enable `QLoggingCategory("desktop.query")` tracing for
    submit/response events recorded in telemetry (see measurement plan).

### Phase 2: Feature Parity Implementation (6 weeks)

- **Guiding question**: Where does PySide6 offer superior UX leverage compared
  with Streamlit, and how do we ensure accessibility parity while reaching
  feature completeness?
- **Primary personas**: Configuration Curator, Rapid Explorer
- **Key UX stories**:
  - As a Configuration Curator, I can manage presets, edit configuration files,
    and trust that validation feedback mirrors Streamlit's safeguards.
  - As a Rapid Explorer, I can toggle progressive disclosure controls to zoom
    from TL;DR summaries to full trace detail without losing context.
  - As any user, I can rely on WCAG-equivalent assistive technologies (screen
    readers, high-contrast themes, keyboard cues).
- **Success metrics**:
  - Feature-complete parity checklist signed off with accessibility parity
    reports.
  - Progressive disclosure usability test with at least three internal users,
    capturing task completion times and qualitative feedback.
  - Automated accessibility smoke tests executing in CI for the PySide6 UI.
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - **Entry**: `QDockWidget` progressive disclosure panels registered in the
    `MainWindow` and toggled via `QAction` shortcuts without layout thrash.
  - **Exit**: `QAccessibleInterface` annotations verified for `QTreeView`
    configuration editors and `QDialog` validation prompts, with NVDA/VoiceOver
    parity notes captured.
  - **Observability**: Emit structured events from `QAction.triggered` handlers
    tagged `ui.progressive_disclosure` for telemetry correlation.

### Phase 3: Professional Features (4 weeks)

- **Guiding question**: How do we expand the UX for power users without
  overwhelming newcomers?
- **Primary personas**: Insights Strategist, Configuration Curator
- **Key UX stories**:
  - As an Insights Strategist, I can open multiple synchronized windows to
    compare queries, with shared session state and consistent keyboard
    shortcuts.
  - As a Configuration Curator, I can annotate knowledge graphs, drag-and-drop
    artifacts, and export professional reports.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Multi-window workflow validated by side-by-side comparison tasks.
  - Latency budget: window orchestration actions respond within 300 ms on
    reference hardware.
  - Accessibility parity maintained through regression testing across new
    interactions (graph annotations, drag-and-drop).
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - **Entry**: `QMdiArea` or `QTabWidget` orchestration scaffold present with
    session state shared through `QObject` signals/slots, and baseline telemetry
    timers wired.
  - **Exit**: Secondary `QMainWindow` instances synchronize query context via
    `QSharedMemory` or signal relays, and `QGraphicsView` annotations persist on
    save/load.
  - **Observability**: Capture `QElapsedTimer` metrics for window focus, drag
    operations, and export actions published to telemetry timers.

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance (3 weeks)

- **Guiding question**: Do our automated tests and manual protocols give the
  Quality Steward confidence across platforms?
- **Primary personas**: Quality Steward, Configuration Curator
- **Key UX stories**:
  - As a Quality Steward, I can run cross-platform PySide6 test suites covering
    unit, integration, accessibility, and performance aspects.
  - As a Configuration Curator, I can validate that PySide6 builds maintain UX
    consistency before the Streamlit interface is deprecated.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Full PySide6 test matrix passing in CI (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - Accessibility parity report generated automatically per release.
  - Performance benchmarks showing equal or better responsiveness than the
    Streamlit baseline.
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - **Entry**: CI artifacts include `pytest --markers requires_ui` suites and
    `QTest` harness logs for `QMainWindow`, `QDialog`, and `QAccessibleWidget`
    surfaces.
  - **Exit**: `QtTest.QSignalSpy` assertions cover `QThreadPool` workloads,
    generating trace files archived with build metadata.
  - **Observability**: Performance counters from `QApplication::processEvents`
    loops export to the telemetry sink for triage dashboards.

### Phase 5: Deprecation and Removal (2 weeks)

- **Guiding question**: How do we support Change Champions and end users during
  the transition away from Streamlit while preserving UX trust?
- **Primary personas**: Change Champion, Rapid Explorer
- **Key UX stories**:
  - As a Change Champion, I can reference clear documentation describing the
    PySide6 experience, highlighting multi-window workflows and progressive
    disclosure improvements.
  - As a Rapid Explorer, I can rely on PySide6 defaults and onboarding flows
    that match or surpass the Streamlit experience.
- **Success metrics**:
  - Documentation updates published with before/after UX narratives.
  - Support tickets related to the migration resolved within one release
    cadence.
  - Streamlit code removal completed with no open UX regressions.
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - **Entry**: `QWizard` onboarding and `QLabel` helper texts aligned with
    updated docs; Streamlit launchers flag deprecated paths.
  - **Exit**: Final release build hides Streamlit modules, and `QMessageBox`
    parity warnings removed after telemetry shows <5% fallback usage.
  - **Observability**: Migration helper prompts emit `ui.migration_nudge`
    events to track onboarding completion.
