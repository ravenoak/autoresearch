# Streamlit Application Refactoring Plan

## Overview

The current `streamlit_app.py` is a monolithic 2513-line file that violates maintainability principles and creates significant barriers to UX improvements. This refactoring plan breaks down the application into modular, maintainable components following SOLID principles and UX best practices.

## Algorithms

## Invariants

## Proof Sketch

## Simulation Expectations

## Traceability

### Tests
- ../../tests/unit/test_streamlit_app.py - Core streamlit functionality tests
- ../../tests/integration/test_streamlit_gui.py - GUI integration tests
- ../../tests/behavior/features/ui_accessibility.feature - Accessibility BDD tests
- ../../tests/unit/ui/test_accessibility.py - Accessibility unit tests

## Current Issues

### Architectural Problems
- **Single Responsibility Violation**: One file handles configuration, query processing, results display, metrics, logging, and UI state management
- **Open/Closed Principle Violation**: Difficult to extend with new features without modifying existing code
- **Dependency Inversion Issues**: Tight coupling between UI components and business logic
- **Interface Segregation Problems**: No clear separation between different UI concerns

### UX Impact
- **Cognitive Overload**: Complex interface overwhelms users with too much information
- **Performance Issues**: Everything loads at once, creating slow initial load times
- **Maintenance Difficulty**: Bugs and features are hard to isolate and test
- **Accessibility Limitations**: Complex interactions make accessibility improvements challenging

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Extraction (2 weeks)
Break the monolithic file into focused, single-responsibility modules:

#### 1.1 Core UI Components (`src/autoresearch/ui/components/`)
- `query_input.py` - Query input and reasoning mode controls
- `results_display.py` - Answer, citations, reasoning, and knowledge graph tabs
- `config_editor.py` - Configuration management interface
- `metrics_dashboard.py` - System and agent performance metrics
- `log_viewer.py` - Structured logging interface
- `query_history.py` - Query history and rerun functionality

#### 1.2 UI State Management (`src/autoresearch/ui/state/`)
- `session_state.py` - Centralized session state management
- `query_state.py` - Query execution and result state
- `config_state.py` - Configuration state and hot-reload handling
- `metrics_state.py` - Metrics collection and history management

#### 1.3 UI Utilities (`src/autoresearch/ui/utils/`)
- `formatting.py` - Result formatting and export utilities
- `validation.py` - Input validation and error handling
- `accessibility.py` - Accessibility utilities and helpers
- `theme.py` - Theme and styling management

### Phase 2: Progressive Enhancement (2 weeks)
Implement progressive enhancement patterns:

#### 2.1 Core Functionality (Works without JavaScript)
- Basic query input and text-based results
- Essential configuration options
- Simple export functionality
- Keyboard navigation support

#### 2.2 Enhanced Features (Progressive Enhancement)
- Rich formatting and markdown rendering
- Interactive visualizations and graphs
- Advanced configuration options
- Real-time metrics and monitoring
- Knowledge graph visualizations

#### 2.3 Graceful Degradation
- Fallback for users with limited JavaScript
- Alternative interfaces for screen readers
- Simplified views for mobile devices
- Offline capability where possible

### Phase 3: Information Architecture (2 weeks)
Redesign information hierarchy and reduce cognitive load:

#### 3.1 Progressive Disclosure
- **Level 1**: TL;DR summary (always visible)
- **Level 2**: Key findings and answer (default expanded)
- **Level 3**: Detailed reasoning and citations (collapsible)
- **Level 4**: Full trace and provenance (expert mode)

#### 3.2 Contextual Help System
- **Tooltips**: Hover help for all controls
- **Progressive Hints**: Context-aware guidance
- **Smart Defaults**: Opinionated defaults based on user type
- **Usage Analytics**: Learn from user behavior patterns

#### 3.3 Adaptive Interface
- **Beginner Mode**: Simplified interface with guided workflows
- **Intermediate Mode**: Balanced feature set (current default)
- **Expert Mode**: Full feature access with advanced options
- **Contextual Switching**: Automatic mode detection based on usage

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (1 week)
Implement performance improvements:

#### 4.1 Lazy Loading
- Load UI components on-demand
- Progressive result rendering
- Background data fetching
- Smart caching strategies

#### 4.2 Resource Management
- Monitor system resources and adapt accordingly
- Reduce memory usage for large result sets
- Optimize visualization rendering
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (1 week)
Comprehensive testing strategy:

#### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify component contracts and interfaces

#### 5.2 Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Test error handling and edge cases

#### 5.3 Accessibility Tests
- Automated WCAG compliance testing
- Screen reader compatibility verification
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation

#### 5.4 Performance Tests
- Load time optimization
- Memory usage monitoring
- Responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing `streamlit_app.py` as legacy wrapper
- Gradual migration to new component architecture
- Feature flags for new capabilities
- Comprehensive integration tests

### Rollout Plan
1. **Internal Testing** (Week 7): Test with development team
2. **Beta Users** (Week 8): Limited release to trusted users
3. **Full Rollout** (Week 9): Complete migration for all users
4. **Legacy Cleanup** (Week 10): Remove deprecated code after validation

This refactoring plan transforms the monolithic Streamlit application into a maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly interface while preserving all existing functionality and improving the overall user experience.
