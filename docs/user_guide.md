# User Guide

This guide highlights the most important controls for navigating Autoresearch
outputs.

## Depth controls

Autoresearch responses are organised by depth levels that determine how much
context is displayed. Depth can be selected from the CLI with `--depth` or via
the Streamlit radio group. Each depth level now advertises the sections it
unlocksâ€”TL;DR summaries, key findings, claim tables, and the full reasoning
trace. The CLI `--help` output lists these combinations, and JSON exports
include a `sections` map so that downstream tools can enforce depth-aware
policies.

The Streamlit app mirrors these options with four toggles:
**Show TL;DR**, **Show key findings**, **Show claim table**, and **Show full
trace**. Toggle defaults are bound to the current depth so that moving to deeper
views surfaces more context without retaining stale preferences.

## Provenance verification

Claim verification is surfaced through the dedicated Provenance panel. Claim
statuses are summarised in natural order (supported, needs review, unsupported)
and the detailed table remains available when the claim table toggle is active.
GraphRAG artifacts are also exposed in the Provenance panel to verify that graph
reasoning supplied the cited evidence. When running at lower depths the panel
explains which artefacts are hidden and how to reveal them.

## Socratic prompts and traces

Socratic prompts adapt to the visible findings and claims, encouraging users to
question evidence and explore follow-up angles. The full trace toggle governs
both reasoning steps and ReAct event visualisations, making it simple to switch
between quick summaries and full audit trails. Trace downloads retain the depth
selection so exported Markdown or JSON matches the on-screen view.
