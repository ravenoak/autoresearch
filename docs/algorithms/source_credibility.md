# Source Credibility Heuristics

Autoresearch estimates credibility using heuristic domain authority scores. Each
recognized domain receives a value between 0 and 1 derived from curated lists of
trusted sources. Higher scores indicate more reliable domains and affect the
weight of a document in the final ranking.
