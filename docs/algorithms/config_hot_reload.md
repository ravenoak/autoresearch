# Config Hot Reload

Hot reload updates configuration without restarting the system. A file or
service watcher emits events when the source changes. The application
validates the new content and swaps it into the active state atomically.

## Complexity

Watchers poll or receive events in constant time. Parsing updated content
runs in ``O(n)`` where ``n`` is file size.

## Edge Cases

- Partial writes can surface invalid configuration snapshots.
- Race conditions may arise when multiple writers update the source.
- Fallback logic is needed when reload validation fails.
