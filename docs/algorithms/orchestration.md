# Orchestration

This note sketches simulations for the circuit breaker and parallel execution.

## Circuit breaker simulation

- Model uses a threshold of three failures and a 30-second cooldown.
- Critical or recoverable errors increment failure count by one; transient
  errors add half.
- Simulation shows three critical failures open the breaker.
- Advancing time beyond the cooldown and reporting a success closes it again.

## Parallel execution simulation

- Agent groups run in a thread pool with at most ``cpu_count - 1`` workers.
- Simulations with varying group sizes confirm deterministic result merging.
- Metrics report execution time, memory delta, and per-group outcomes for
  analysis.
