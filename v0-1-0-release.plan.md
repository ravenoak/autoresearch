# V0.1.0 Release Readiness Assessment and Remediation Plan

## Executive Summary: EMPIRICAL DATA UPDATE - October 23, 2025

### Assessment Dates: October 17 and October 22â€“23, 2025 (Updated with Empirical
Data)

**UPDATED ASSESSMENT**: Project shows significant progress toward v0.1.0 readiness based on empirical data:

**MEASURED METRICS** (October 17â€“22, 2025):
- **Coverage**: 71.94% across 21,943 lines (October 17, 2025 17:14â€¯UTC
  `coverage.xml` export)
- **Pytest Collection**: 1,907 tests discovered (1,740 collected, 167 deselected)
  in the October 22, 2025 19:13â€¯UTC baseline
- **xfail/skip Markers**: 35 total (reduced from 127 - 74% improvement)
- **Type Safety**: âœ… Full mypy strict compliance (150 source files)
- **Code Quality**: âœ… Zero critical linting errors (E9,F63,F7,F82)
- **Release Status**: v0.1.0a1 tag not created; release engineering paused until
  verify and coverage succeed

**REMAINING ISSUES**:
1. **Documentation Inconsistencies**: Multiple contradictory release status claims
2. **Integration Tests**: 28% deselection rate indicates incomplete mocking
3. **Test Flakiness**: Some tests still show intermittent failures
4. **Coverage Claims**: Documentation claims 69.76% but measurement shows 71.94%

## 1. EMPIRICAL DATA CORRECTIONS

### 1.1 Coverage Measurement Reality

**Previous Finding**: Misleading coverage claims - only 57 lines measured
**Empirical Reality** (October 17, 2025):
- `coverage.xml`: 21,943 lines-valid, 15,786 lines-covered, 71.94% coverage
- **Comprehensive coverage measurement exists** (819KB file vs 3KB baseline)
- **Documentation claims need updating** (69.76% â†’ 71.94%)

### 1.2 Test Collection Reality

**Previous Finding**: 127 xfail/skip markers across 44 files
**Empirical Reality** (October 22, 2025 19:13â€¯UTC collection baseline):
- **35 xfail/skip markers** (74% reduction from 127)
- **1,907 tests discovered** with **1,740 collected** and **167 deselected**
  (exceeds the previously documented 1,646 figure)
- **Specific flaky tests now pass**:
  - `test_interleaved_storage_paths_share_cache` âœ… PASSED
  - `test_external_lookup_adaptive_k_increases_fetch` âœ… PASSED

### 1.3 Release Status Reality

**Previous Finding**: Documentation contradictions about release status
**Empirical Reality** (October 23, 2025):
- **No v0.1.0a1 tag exists**; release engineering remains paused pending green
  verify/coverage evidence.
- **v0.1.0 commit exists** (9d8b4926) but no v0.1.0 tag.
- **Documentation inconsistent** (some still claim v0.1.0 released, others
  report alpha readiness).

## 2. UPDATED CRITICAL ISSUES

### 2.1 Documentation Accuracy Crisis (REMAINING)

**Finding**: Documentation contains contradictory release status and coverage claims.

**Current Evidence**:
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Claims "0.1.0 - 2025-10-17" but no v0.1.0 tag exists
- `STATUS.md`: Claims v0.1.0a1 released but remediation plan shows issues
- Coverage claims: 69.76% (documentation) vs 71.94% (measured)
- Test counts: 1,646 (documentation) vs 1,907 discovered / 1,740 collected

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Audit ALL documentation for accuracy with empirical data
- [ ] Remove false v0.1.0 release claims (no tag exists)
- [ ] Update coverage claims to 71.94% with measurement date
- [ ] Align test counts with actual collection results
- [ ] Clarify v0.1.0a1 vs v0.1.0 status

### 2.2 Integration Test Incompleteness (REMAINING)

**Finding**: Integration tests still show 28% deselection rate.

**Current Evidence**:
- Integration tests: 368 active, 145 deselected (28% deselection)
- LM Studio tests: 3 skip markers for external service issues
- HTTP adapter tests: 10+ skip markers for complex mocking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete external service mocking for LM Studio
- [ ] Reduce integration test deselection to <10%
- [ ] Implement HTTP adapter mocking for complex scenarios
- [ ] Verify all non-deselected integration tests pass

### 2.3 Test Stability Validation (REMAINING)

**Finding**: While xfail count reduced significantly, some tests may still be flaky.

**Current Evidence**:
- 35 xfail/skip markers (down from 127)
- Most markers are legitimate skips (UI tests, complex mocking)
- Previously flaky tests now pass consistently

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Verify all non-skip tests pass consistently (5 consecutive runs)
- [ ] Document reasons for all remaining xfail/skip markers
- [ ] Ensure no undocumented flaky tests remain

## 3. UPDATED REMEDIATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Documentation Corrections (Week 1) - IN PROGRESS

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fix misleading stakeholders

#### Task 1.1: Update Coverage Claims with Empirical Data
**Owner**: Documentation Lead

1. Update CHANGELOG.md: 69.76% â†’ 71.94% (measured October 17, 2025)
2. Update STATUS.md: current coverage is 71.94% (measured October 17, 2025)
3. Update ROADMAP.md and other docs with accurate coverage claims
4. Document measurement method and date stamp

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All coverage claims updated to 71.94% with October 17, 2025 date stamp
- [ ] No contradictory coverage percentages across documentation
- [ ] Measurement method documented

#### Task 1.2: Clarify Release Status
**Owner**: Project Manager
**Effort**: 4 hours

**Actions**:
1. Audit CHANGELOG.md - correct "0.1.0 - 2025-10-17" entry (no v0.1.0 tag exists)
2. Clarify STATUS.md - v0.1.0a1 released, v0.1.0 in preparation
3. Update release status consistently across all documentation
4. Document actual release state clearly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Release status consistent across all documents
- [ ] v0.1.0a1 status clarified (released October 16, 2025)
- [ ] v0.1.0 status clarified (commit exists, tag pending)
- [ ] No contradictory release claims

#### Task 1.3: Update Test Count Claims
**Owner**: Test Lead
**Effort**: 2 hours

**Actions**:
1. Update all documentation: 1,646 tests â†’ 1,907 discovered / 1,740 collected
   (measured October 22, 2025 19:13â€¯UTC)
2. Document test categorization: unit, integration, behavior
3. Explain 28% integration test deselection
4. Document xfail/skip count (35 total)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test counts updated to 1,907 discovered / 1,740 collected with
  measurement date
- [ ] All documents have consistent test count claims
- [ ] Deselection percentages documented and explained

### Phase 2: Integration Test Completion (Weeks 2-3) - ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

**Priority**: HIGH - Required for v0.1.0

**EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT** (October 17, 2025):
- **Integration Tests**: 350 passed, 20 skipped, 145 deselected (28% deselection rate)
- **Core Tests Only**: 311 collected, 202 deselected (65% collection rate for core functionality)
- **Root Cause**: 57 tests require optional extras, 88 tests marked as `slow` or `pending`
- **Previously Flaky Tests**: âœ… Now pass consistently

**RECOMMENDATION**: For v0.1.0 release, focus on ensuring core functionality tests pass without requiring optional extras. The 28% deselection rate is acceptable for alpha release if:
1. All core functionality is tested (non-optional-extra tests)
2. Optional extra tests are properly marked and documented
3. Mocking strategy is documented for future releases

**Updated Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Core integration tests (non-optional-extra) have <10% deselection rate
- [ ] All collected integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Optional extra tests are properly marked with `requires_*` markers
- [ ] Integration test mocking strategy documented

### Phase 3: Final Verification (Week 4) - READINESS ASSESSMENT
