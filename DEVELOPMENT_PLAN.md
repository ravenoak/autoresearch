# Autoresearch Development Plan

## Overview

This development plan outlines the approach for implementing the Autoresearch project, a local-first research assistant that performs evidence-driven investigation through a dialectical, Promise-Theory, multi-agent architecture. The plan follows a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, with dialectical reasoning applied to each component.

## 1. Development Methodology

### Thesis
We will use a BDD/TDD-first approach where:
1. Behaviors are defined in Gherkin feature files
2. Step definitions are implemented to test these behaviors
3. Unit tests are written for all components
4. Implementation follows to make tests pass
5. Refactoring is performed while maintaining test coverage

### Antithesis
Potential challenges with this approach:
- BDD/TDD can slow initial development
- Some components may be difficult to test in isolation
- External dependencies (LLMs, search APIs) complicate testing
- Dialectical reasoning implementation may be complex

### Synthesis
To address these challenges:
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Implement clear interfaces for all components
- Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- Develop a testing strategy for each component type
- Balance test coverage with development speed
- Use CI/CD to ensure tests remain passing

## 2. Project Structure and Components

### Thesis
The project should follow a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:
- CLI interface (main.py)
- API interface (api.py)
- Configuration management (config.py)
- Agent implementations (agents/)
- Orchestration (orchestration/)
- Storage (storage.py)
- Output formatting (output_format.py)
- Data models (models.py)

### Antithesis
Potential issues with this structure:
- Tight coupling between components
- Unclear boundaries between modules
- Difficulty in testing components in isolation
- Potential for circular dependencies

### Synthesis
To ensure modularity and testability:
- Use dependency injection for all components
- Define clear interfaces for each component
- Use abstract base classes for extensibility
- Implement a plugin system for agents and backends
- Ensure unidirectional dependencies

## 10. Conclusion

This enhanced development plan builds on the existing framework while addressing identified gaps and priorities. By following a BDD/TDD approach with dialectical reasoning, we ensure that all requirements are met, the code is well-tested and maintainable, and the system is extensible for future enhancements.

The plan prioritizes completing the test implementation first, followed by agent implementation, storage and knowledge management, interfaces and output, and finally observability and performance. This approach ensures that we build on a solid foundation of tests while addressing the most critical functionality first.

By applying dialectical reasoning to each component, we have considered potential challenges and developed strategies to address them, resulting in a more robust and well-thought-out implementation.
