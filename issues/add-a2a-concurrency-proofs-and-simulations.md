# Add A2A concurrency proofs and simulations

## Context
The A2A interface handles concurrent queries but lacks formal proof or
simulation validating its behavior. The failing
`tests/unit/test_a2a_interface.py::TestA2AInterface::test_handle_query_concurrent`
points to gaps in our reasoning and documentation. Formalizing this module
will prevent future regressions.

## Dependencies
None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide a proof sketch or formal argument for the A2A concurrency model.
- Supply a simulation demonstrating expected concurrent behavior.
- Add tests exercising the proof and simulation paths.
- Reference proofs and simulations from the relevant specs and docs.

## Status
Open
