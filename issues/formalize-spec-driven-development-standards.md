# Formalize spec-driven development standards

## Context
The project seeks rigorous research orchestration but lacks unified
specifications across modules. Some algorithms, such as storage eviction,
have informal proofs, while others rely on ad hoc behavior. Establishing
spec-driven, domain-driven, and test-driven guidelines will align
implementation and aid verification.

## Dependencies
- [add-storage-eviction-proofs-and-simulations](add-storage-eviction-proofs-and-simulations.md)
- [add-test-coverage-for-optional-components](add-test-coverage-for-optional-components.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Define a specification template outlining algorithms, invariants, and proofs.
- Add specs for orchestrator scheduling and search ranking modules.
- Document where simulations or formal methods are required.
- Update developer documentation with spec-driven workflow guidance.

## Status
Open
