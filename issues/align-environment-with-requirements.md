# Align environment with requirements

## Context
The project requires Python 3.12 and common development tools, but some
setups lag behind. The environment must match documented requirements to
avoid failures and missing tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Python 3.12 is installed and selected as the default interpreter.
- Development tools such as task, flake8, mypy, pytest, pytest-bdd and
  pydantic are available in the virtual environment.

## Status
Open
