# Align environment with requirements

## Context
The environment setup instructions still have gaps, leading to inconsistent developer installs. Some
systems miss Python 3.12 or required tooling, causing task failures and missing dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documented steps install Python 3.12 and all required development tools.
- `task install` completes on a clean machine without manual fixes.
- Environment checks verify versions align with project requirements.

## Status
Open
