# Coordinate deep research enhancement initiative

## Context
We adopted the September 26, 2025 dialectical plan that sequences adaptive
gating, per-claim audits, planner upgrades, GraphRAG, evaluation harnesses, and
cost-aware routing. Execution requires coordinated scheduling across existing
roadmap milestones, documentation updates, and telemetry tracking. Phase 1 is
now complete; the release sweep and deep research plan confirm the gate and
audit telemetry ship in the alpha pipeline while later phases remain in flight.

## Dependencies
- [prepare-first-alpha-release](prepare-first-alpha-release.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Phased work items (issues, docs, roadmap) exist for each enhancement area.
- STATUS.md and ROADMAP.md cross-reference the initiative and phase ordering.
- Documentation and pseudo-code describe the new components ahead of
  implementation.
- Resource, risk, and schedule updates are reported in STATUS.md after each
  phase checkpoint.
- Completion criteria are reviewed with project maintainers before phase
  transitions.

## Status
Open
