# Deliver evidence pipeline 2.0

## Context
Phase 1 of the Deep Research Enhancement Initiative requires per-claim audits,
iterative retrieval, entailment scoring, and self-checking ensembles. We must
extend the evidence pipeline so every claim is tagged with support status and
citations before synthesis completes.

## Dependencies
- [prepare-first-alpha-release](prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
- [coordinate-deep-research-enhancement-initiative](coordinate-deep-research-enhancement-initiative.md)
- [implement-adaptive-orchestration-gate](implement-adaptive-orchestration-gate.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Claim extractor identifies sentence-level assertions from drafts and
  syntheses.
- Retrieval loop expands queries, ranks snippets, and stores metadata for
  audit reproduction.
- Entailment and stability scores produce `supported`, `weak`, or `disputed`
  statuses with associated source snippets.
- Unsupported claims force revision, hedging, or removal before responses are
  emitted.
- Output schemas, documentation, and tests cover the audit data contract.
