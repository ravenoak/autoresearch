# Resolve test failures and task tooling

## Context
Go Task was missing, preventing `task check` and `task verify` from running.
The runner has now been installed in `.venv` and smoke tests pass with
`flake8`, `mypy`, and a subset of unit tests. Full test suites and behavioral
scenarios still need to be stabilized before the alpha release.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Go Task installed in `.venv` and available on `PATH`.
- `task check` and `task verify` succeed on a fresh clone.
- Unit tests pass without failures.
- Behavior test suite passes or scenarios are updated to be reliable.
- `STATUS.md` and `TASK_PROGRESS.md` document the passing test results.

## Status
Open
