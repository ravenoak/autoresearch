# Assemble release notes and validate README

## Context
The alpha release checklist in docs/release_plan.md calls for preliminary
release notes and verified README instructions before tagging the first
pre-release. These documents ensure users can install and understand the
project. They have not been assembled or reviewed in the repository.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Draft release notes summarizing current features and limitations.
- README installation and usage sections verified against a clean environment.
- Cross-links between release notes and README added where appropriate.

## Status
Open
