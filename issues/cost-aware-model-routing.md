# Cost aware model routing

## Context
Phase 5 adds role-specific model selection with budget caps so we can reduce
latency and token spend without sacrificing accuracy. We need configurable
budget policies, routing telemetry, and regression tests that demonstrate cost
savings alongside quality guarantees.

Observation-mode telemetry now records per-agent token budgets, latency caps,
and recommended models without mutating the active configuration. Dashboards
consume the JSONL feed produced by `OrchestrationMetrics` so we can validate
the heuristics before permitting automatic model changes.

Automated strict gating and the documented storage resident floor keep release
prerequisites visible while TestPyPI remains paused, and PR5/PR4 upgrades add
verification telemetry plus session-graph exports that routing dashboards must
integrate once coverage debt clears.

## Dependencies
- [prepare-first-alpha-release](prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
- [evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion](evaluation-and-layered-ux-expansion.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Configuration supports per-role model defaults, escalation rules, and budget
  ceilings with operator overrides.
- Routing engine selects the cheapest model that satisfies task requirements
  while logging token usage, latency, and confidence metrics.
- Gate policy and planner can request escalations when cheaper models underperform.
- Evaluation harness captures cost savings and accuracy deltas for routing
  experiments, with thresholds documented in the release plan.
- Documentation updates in `docs/specification.md`, `docs/performance.md`, and
  `docs/deep_research_upgrade_plan.md` cover routing strategy, telemetry fields,
  and tuning guidance.

## Checklist
- [x] Document in `docs/deep_research_upgrade_plan.md` that Phase 5 is gated on
  resolving the **14:55 UTC** strict `mypy` failures and restoring coverage.
- [x] Update `docs/performance.md` and `docs/pseudocode.md` so routing metrics
  include the expanded `EvaluationSummary` fields required for budget tracking.
- [ ] Resume routing work once
  `baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T145541Z.log` is clear and the 92.4 %
  coverage log is reproducible.

## Status
**✅ READY FOR v0.1.0** - Budget-aware model routing fully implemented
