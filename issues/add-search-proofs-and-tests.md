# Add search proofs and tests

## Context
Search components lack formal validation. Ranking algorithms and HTTP session
utilities operate without proofs or simulations, leaving correctness and failure
recovery unspecified.

## Dependencies
- [improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies](archive/improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide proofs or simulations for ranking logic and HTTP session handling.
- Add unit and integration tests raising search module coverage above eighty
  percent.
- Document reasoning and assumptions in `docs/algorithms/search.md`.

## Status
Open
