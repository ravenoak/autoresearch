# Prepare alpha release

## Context
The project targets an initial alpha release, but foundational pieces remain
incomplete. Environment reproducibility is fragile, tests are unstable, and
packaging steps lack verification. A consolidated plan is needed to coordinate
these efforts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Record the following PR-sized tasks with linked issues and dependency notes:
  - Clarify environment bootstrap (see `document-environment-bootstrap.md`).
  - Stabilize the integration test suite (see `stabilize-integration-tests.md`).
  - Verify packaging workflow and add fallback when DuckDB extensions cannot be
    downloaded.
  - Add coverage gates and regression checks in CI.
  - Provide proofs or simulations for ranking algorithms and agent
    coordination.
- Ensure roadmap and release plan capture the updated sequencing and
  requirements.

## Status
Open
