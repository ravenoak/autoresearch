# Add ranking algorithm proofs and simulations

## Context
Hybrid search currently merges backend scores without a formal proof of
correctness or simulations validating edge cases. Establishing mathematical
underpinnings and empirical validation will increase confidence before the
alpha release.

## Dependencies
- [hybrid-search-ranking-benchmarks](hybrid-search-ranking-benchmarks.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Derive and document the ranking formula with supporting proof or citations.
- Implement simulations comparing ranking results across representative
  datasets.
- Publish findings in `docs/` with formulas and graphs.
- Add tests ensuring simulation and implementation remain aligned.

## Status
Open
