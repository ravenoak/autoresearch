# Add OxiGraph backend proofs

## Context
The OxiGraph storage backend lacks formal proofs or simulations verifying its
initialization and persistence behavior. The current spec covers idempotent
schema creation for DuckDB but does not provide equivalent rigor for OxiGraph.
Adding proofs and a small simulation will align the backend with the project's
spec-driven approach.

## Dependencies
- [fix-oxigraph-backend-initialization](fix-oxigraph-backend-initialization.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specification includes a proof of correct initialization and persistence for
the OxiGraph backend.
- Simulation demonstrates expected behavior under repeated setup and teardown.
- Documentation references the proof and simulation.

## Status
Open
