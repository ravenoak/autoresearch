# Add API authentication proofs

## Context
The API authentication algorithm describes constant-time credential checks but
lacks formal proofs or simulations confirming its security and role
enforcement. Adding proofs and a small simulation would strengthen the
spec-driven approach.

## Dependencies
- [fix-api-authentication-regressions](fix-api-authentication-regressions.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specification includes a formal proof of constant-time comparison and role permission logic.
- Simulation demonstrates expected behavior under valid and invalid credentials.
- Documentation references the proof and simulation.

## Status
Open
