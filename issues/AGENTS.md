# Issues Directory Guidelines

These instructions apply to files in the `issues/` directory.

## Snapshot
- **Purpose:** track in-repo tasks and decisions.
- **Primary language:** Markdown.
- **Key outputs:** open issue files and archived resolutions.

## Conventions
- Use the template and naming conventions in [issues/README.md](README.md).
- File names must be slugged titles; numeric identifiers in filenames or ticket
  content are prohibited. Reference issues by slugged filename.
- Open tickets stay in this directory. Move completed ones to `archive/` with
  `Status` set to `Archived` and do not rename them.
- Keep this file current as issue tooling evolves.

## Reasoning and Continuous Improvement
- Revisit issue templates as project needs change.
- Capture rationale and alternatives within issue discussions.

## AGENTS.md Compliance
- Scope: `issues/` directory; nested `AGENTS.md` files override these rules.
- This AGENTS.md follows the [AGENTS.md spec](https://gist.github.com).
