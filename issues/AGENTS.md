# Issues directory guidelines

Follow these rules when managing in-repo tickets.

- Use the template and naming conventions in [README.md](README.md).
- File names are slugged titles with no numeric prefixes.
- Open tickets stay in this directory. Move completed ones to `archive/`
  with `Status` set to `Archived` and do not rename them.
- Keep this file and the repository root `AGENTS.md` current when issue
  tooling evolves.
