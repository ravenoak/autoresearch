# Simulate distributed orchestrator performance

## Context
Scaling research workflows across multiple nodes requires validated models of
scheduler behavior. Current benchmarks target single-node scenarios and lack
analysis of coordination overhead, failure recovery, and throughput at scale.
A dedicated issue will guide simulations and proofs to characterize distributed
orchestrator performance.

## Dependencies
- None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Simulation suite exercises orchestrator across multiple nodes with varying
  workloads and failure conditions.
- Analytical proofs or formulas describe scheduling overhead and scalability.
- Benchmarks document resource usage, throughput trends, and failure recovery
  behavior.
- Results inform performance targets for the 0.3.0 milestone.

## Status
Open
