# Simulate distributed orchestrator performance

## Context
The 0.3.0 milestone targets distributed execution and monitoring. Simulations
are needed to model orchestrator behavior under load and guide performance
tuning.

## Dependencies
None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide simulations that model distributed orchestrator throughput and
  latency.
- Document assumptions and formulas supporting the simulations.
- Outline follow-up benchmarks or tooling based on results. Reference
  [multiprocess orchestrator sim][sim] and
  [distributed orchestrator benchmark][bench]

[bench]: ../scripts/distributed_orchestrator_perf_benchmark.py


## Status
