# Add orchestration proofs and tests

## Context
The orchestration package lacks proofs or simulations validating its circuit
breaker, error handling, and parallel execution algorithms. Coverage reports
show many orchestration modules at **0%** coverage, leaving behavior and
resource guarantees unspecified.

## Milestone
- 0.1.0a1 (2026-04-15)

## Dependencies
- [improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies](archive/improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide proofs or simulations demonstrating deterministic circuit breaker
  behavior and error recovery guarantees.
- Add tests exercising execution and parallel utilities, raising orchestration
  module coverage above **80%**.
- Document reasoning and assumptions in `docs/algorithms/orchestration.md`.

## Status
Open
