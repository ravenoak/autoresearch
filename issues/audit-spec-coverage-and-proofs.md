# Audit spec coverage and proofs

## Context
Spec documents exist for most modules, but coverage may be incomplete or
outdated. A thorough audit is needed to confirm every component has a
corresponding specification, proof, simulation, or formula where appropriate.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Inventory maps each module to its spec, algorithm, and proof documents.
- Missing or stale sections are documented with follow-up issues.
- STATUS.md notes audit results.

## Status
Open
