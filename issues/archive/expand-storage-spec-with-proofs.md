# Expand storage spec with proofs and simulations

## Context
The current storage specification outlines goals but lacks detailed
invariants, proof sketches, and simulation results. A richer spec would
clarify state transitions, eviction guarantees, and concurrency behavior.

## Dependencies
- None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Storage spec documents invariants for claim persistence and eviction.
- Proof sketches justify concurrency safety and RAM budget enforcement.
- Simulation results or benchmarks demonstrate schema idempotency and performance.

## Status
Archived
