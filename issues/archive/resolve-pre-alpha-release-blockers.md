# Resolve pre-alpha release blockers

## Context
The project targets its first public alpha (0.1.0a1). Package metadata,
dependency builds, and behavior tests now work as expected. `task verify`
runs end-to-end and produces coverage reports.

## Dependencies
- [fix-task-verify-package-metadata-errors](fix-task-verify-package-metadata-errors.md)
- [address-task-verify-dependency-builds](address-task-verify-dependency-builds.md)
- [restore-behavior-driven-test-suite](restore-behavior-driven-test-suite.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `task verify` completes without missing-package errors.
- Behavior-driven tests run and pass in the default environment.
- Line coverage reaches at least 90% with reports updated.
- Release steps and known limitations documented for tagging 0.1.0a1.
