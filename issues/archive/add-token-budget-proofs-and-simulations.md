# Add token budget proofs and simulations

## Context
The token budget adaptation algorithm is documented with formulas and an
outline proof, yet empirical validation is limited. Tests like
`tests/unit/test_metrics_token_budget_spec.py` fail, indicating behavior may
not match the specification.

## Milestone

- 0.1.0a1 (2026-04-15)

## Dependencies

- [improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies](improve-test-coverage-and-streamline-dependencies.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide mathematical proof or simulation demonstrating the algorithm's convergence and bounds.
- Add tests validating token budget updates against the proof.
- Update documentation in `docs/algorithms/token_budgeting.md` with derivation and assumptions.

## Status
