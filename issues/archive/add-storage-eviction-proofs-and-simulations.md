# Add storage eviction proofs and simulations

## Context
StorageManager enforces RAM budgets with heuristics but lacks a formal proof of
eviction correctness or extended simulations under varied workloads.
Strengthening its theoretical foundation will increase confidence in memory
management.

## Dependencies
None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide a mathematical proof or formal argument for the RAM budget algorithm
  in `StorageManager._enforce_ram_budget`.
- Extend `scripts/storage_eviction_sim.py` to explore edge cases and
  concurrency.
- Document formulas, assumptions, and results in `docs/algorithms/storage.md`.
- Add tests verifying simulation and implementation remain aligned.
