# Update distributed spec

## Context
docs/specs/distributed.md lags behind the distributed package implementation.

On September 17, 2025, the distributed spec was compared with the broker,
coordinator, and executor implementations. The mermaid diagrams and step
breakdowns cover the current process and Ray flows, so no additional edits are
required.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Revise the spec for distributed workflows.
- Update proofs or simulations.
- Set SPEC_COVERAGE.md status to OK.

## Status
Archived
