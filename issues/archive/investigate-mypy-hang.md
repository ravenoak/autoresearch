# Investigate mypy hang during verification

Running `uv run mypy src` appears to hang without producing output even after several minutes. This prevents `task verify` from completing.

## Context
`mypy` is expected to complete as part of the verification workflow, but current runs stall indefinitely. The cause may be configuration or dependency related.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Determine why `mypy` does not complete.
- Ensure `uv run mypy src` finishes successfully.
- Document any configuration changes needed.

## Status
Archived


This resolves the hang observed during verification.
