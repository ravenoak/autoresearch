# Add storage initialization proofs

## Context
The storage-backends specification lacks formal proofs and simulations for
initialization and teardown behavior, especially when DuckDB extensions are
missing. Failing tests highlight gaps in documented invariants.

## Dependencies
- [resolve-storage-persistence-test-failure](resolve-storage-persistence-test-failure.md)
- [fix-duckdb-storage-schema-initialization](fix-duckdb-storage-schema-initialization.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Storage initialization invariants are formally proven or justified.
- Simulations cover extension download failures and table creation.
- Documentation links to the new proofs and corresponding tests.

## Status
