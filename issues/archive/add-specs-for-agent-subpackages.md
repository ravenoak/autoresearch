# Add specs for agent subpackages

## Context
Packages `agents/dialectical` and `agents/specialized` are absent from `SPEC_COVERAGE.md`,
suggesting their specifications are undocumented.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- `SPEC_COVERAGE.md` lists `autoresearch/agents/dialectical` and `autoresearch/agents/specialized`.
- Each entry links to a specification document.

## Status
Archived
