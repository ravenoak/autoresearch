# Benchmark scheduler queue saturation

## Context
Recent benchmarking near service capacity revealed sustained queue growth even
as workers scaled. Potential mitigation includes expanding worker pools,
throttling arrivals, applying queue limits with backpressure, and implementing
adaptive load shedding.

## Dependencies
- None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Mitigation strategies are documented and reviewed.
- Benchmark findings in
  [docs/orchestrator_perf.md](../../docs/orchestrator_perf.md) inform follow-up
  tasks.
