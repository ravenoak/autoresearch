# Audit proofs and simulations

## Context
Some algorithms include proofs and simulations, but coverage is inconsistent.
Modules like distributed coordination, caching, and advanced search lack explicit
validation, making correctness and resource guarantees unclear.

## Dependencies

None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Catalog existing algorithm documentation and note missing proofs or simulations.
- Add or reference proofs or simulations for components that lack them.
- Update `docs/algorithms/` with summaries of any new proofs or simulations.
- Reference follow-up tickets for modules that still require formal validation.

## Findings
- Cache, distributed coordination, and search now include proofs or simulations
  and link to specs and tests.
- Remaining modules without validation are listed in
  `docs/algorithms/README.md` under *Pending*.

## Status
Archived
