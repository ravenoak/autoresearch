# Fix concurrent query interface behavior

## Context
`test_a2a_interface.py::test_concurrent_queries` expected three results but
none were returned, implying concurrency or scheduling logic is missing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement proper concurrent query handling in the A2A interface.
- Verify the test returns the expected number of results.
- Add simulations covering race conditions.

## Status
