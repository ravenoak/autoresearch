# Update monitor spec

## Context
docs/specs/monitor.md is older than monitor package changes.

On September 17, 2025, the monitor spec was reviewed against the CLI module
and Prometheus endpoint implementations. The document covers metrics, resource
sampling, graph inspection, and node health reporting, so the existing content
matches the code.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Refresh the spec to describe current monitoring features.
- Update related proofs or simulations.
- Set SPEC_COVERAGE.md status to OK.

## Status
Archived
