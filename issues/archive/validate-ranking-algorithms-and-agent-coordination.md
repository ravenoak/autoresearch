# Validate ranking algorithms and agent coordination

## Context
The release requires confidence in ranking algorithms and agent
coordination strategies. Proofs or simulations are needed to confirm
expected behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide proofs or simulation results for ranking algorithm correctness.
- Demonstrate agent coordination through tests or simulations.
- Capture findings in documentation for future reference.

See [docs/algorithms/validation.md](../docs/algorithms/validation.md)
for the collected results.

## Status
