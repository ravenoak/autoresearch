# Add redis distributed workflows specification

## Context
Redis-backed distributed workflows lack a formal specification detailing coordination and failure recovery. Without this, design decisions remain implicit.

## Dependencies
- [configure-redis-service-for-tests](configure-redis-service-for-tests.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docs/algorithms/distributed_workflows.md` describes Redis coordination, latency, and fault recovery.
- `docs/specification.md` checklist marks `redis_distributed_workflows` as covered.
- Behavior scenarios reference the specification when exercising distributed workflows.
