# Implement adaptive orchestration gate

## Context
The September 26, 2025 dialectical review identified the need for a scout
pass, gating policy, and telemetry so easy queries can exit early while hard
cases escalate into debate. We must integrate the gate ahead of Phase 1 of the
Deep Research Enhancement Initiative and ensure all outputs surface per-claim
audit data. The September 30, 2025 release sweep verifies the scout gate,
telemetry, and CLI entrypoints now operate within the alpha pipeline.

## Dependencies
- [prepare-first-alpha-release](prepare-first-alpha-release.md)
- [coordinate-deep-research-enhancement-initiative](coordinate-deep-research-enhancement-initiative.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Scout pass generates draft answers, retrieval bundles, and uncertainty
  signals before the main loop runs.
- Gating policy returns explicit exit/escalate decisions logged for telemetry
  and evaluation harness reuse.
- Dialectical debate integrates with the gate without regressing existing
  orchestration metrics or error handling.
- Per-claim audit tables populate QueryResponse objects whenever the gate exits
  early.
- Documentation and tests are updated to explain the gating stages and metrics.
