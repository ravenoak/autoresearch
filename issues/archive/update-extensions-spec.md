# Update extensions spec

## Context
docs/specs/extensions.md predates recent changes.

On September 17, 2025, the spec was compared with
`src/autoresearch/extensions.VSSExtensionLoader`. The document now details the
offline ladder, stub marker, and strict-mode error propagation, so no further
updates are required.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bring the spec up to date with extension loading logic.
- Revise proofs or simulations if needed.
- Update SPEC_COVERAGE.md.

## Status
Archived
