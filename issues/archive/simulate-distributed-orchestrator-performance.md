# Simulate distributed orchestrator performance

## Context
The 0.3.0 milestone targets distributed execution and monitoring. Simulations
are needed to model orchestrator behavior under load and guide performance
tuning.

## Dependencies
None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide simulations that model distributed orchestrator throughput and
  latency.
- Document assumptions and formulas supporting the simulations.
- Outline follow-up benchmarks or tooling based on results.
- Link to [scripts/distributed_perf_sim.py](../scripts/distributed_perf_sim.py)
  and
  [scripts/distributed_orchestrator_perf_benchmark.py](../scripts/distributed_orchestrator_perf_benchmark.py)
  for further analysis.

## Findings
- Analytical and benchmark simulations produce matching throughput and
  latency curves. Plots are stored under `docs/images/` and assumptions are
  recorded in `docs/orchestrator_perf.md`.

## Status
