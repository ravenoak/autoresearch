# Simulate distributed orchestrator performance

## Context
Evaluate orchestrator throughput and resource use by simulating distributed nodes. The goal is to
identify scaling limits and measure coordination overhead before real deployments.

## Dependencies
- None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Simulated workload demonstrates orchestrator behavior across multiple processes.
- Report summarizes throughput, latency and bottlenecks with recommendations.
- Findings documented in [docs/orchestrator_perf.md](../../docs/orchestrator_perf.md).

## Status
Archived
