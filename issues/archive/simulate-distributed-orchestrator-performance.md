# Simulate distributed orchestrator performance

## Context
The distributed orchestrator lacks quantitative evaluation. Without simulation,
scaling limits and resource bottlenecks remain unclear, risking degraded
throughput under load.

## Dependencies
None.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build a simulation or micro-benchmark to model orchestrator scheduling and
  resource usage.
- Document formulas and methodology in `docs/`.
- Add tests or analysis verifying results and guiding tuning.

## Status
