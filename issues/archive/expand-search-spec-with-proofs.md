# Expand search spec with proofs

## Context
The search specification lacked detail on retrieval algorithms and formal
assurances. This issue captures the work to document keyword, vector, and
hybrid search behaviors along with invariants and validation tests.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Describe keyword, vector, and hybrid algorithms in the search spec.
- Document invariants such as result ordering and idempotent indexing.
- Provide proof sketches for the invariants.
- Reference simulations or tests demonstrating these behaviors.

## Status
Archived
