# Add storage proofs and simulations

## Context
DuckDB-backed storage lacks formal validation. Tests reveal schema initialization
and eviction logic can fail without clear guarantees. Rigorous reasoning and
simulations are needed to justify the storage design and prevent regressions.

## Milestone
- 0.1.0a1 (2026-06-15)

## Dependencies
- None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide a proof or simulation demonstrating idempotent schema initialization.
- Simulate eviction sequences to verify RAM budget enforcement.
- Add tests exercising these proofs under concurrency and failure scenarios.
- Document assumptions and results in `docs/algorithms/storage.md`.

## Status
