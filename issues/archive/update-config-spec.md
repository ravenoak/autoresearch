# Update config spec

## Context
docs/specs/config.md is older than src/autoresearch/config.

The configuration spec was reviewed on September 17, 2025. It documents the
weight normalization validator, hot reload behaviour, and nested model layout
present in `src/autoresearch/config`. Proof links remain valid, so no further
changes are required.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Align the spec with current configuration logic.
- Provide updated proofs or simulations.
- Mark SPEC_COVERAGE.md as OK.

## Status
Archived
