# Update API spec

## Context
docs/specs/api.md predates recent changes to the API package.

On September 17, 2025, the spec was reviewed against the FastAPI router,
middleware, and streaming helpers. The document now covers authentication,
rate limiting, metrics, and streaming endpoints, so no further edits are
required for the current implementation.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Revise the spec to reflect current endpoints and behavior.
- Update associated proofs or simulations.
- Mark SPEC_COVERAGE.md status as OK.

## Status
Archived
