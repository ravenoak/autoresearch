# Update CLI helpers spec

## Context
docs/specs/cli-helpers.md is older than the implementation.

The document was reviewed on September 17, 2025 and now matches the helper
module, including the fuzzy matching, agent group parsing, and warning
rendering behaviours. Proof references remain valid, so no further edits are
required.

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Refresh the spec to match current CLI helper functions.
- Add or update proof/simulation references.
- Update SPEC_COVERAGE.md status.

## Status
Archived
