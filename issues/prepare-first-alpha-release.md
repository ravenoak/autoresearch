# Prepare first alpha release

## Context
Version 0.1.0a1 will be the project's first public alpha. After running
`scripts/codex_setup.sh`, `task check` and `task verify` execute but both
fail at `tests/unit/test_monitor_cli.py` asserting `130 == 0`. Behavior
tests still cannot collect because `pytest-bdd` does not discover the
feature directory. Integration tests now run with `redis` installed, and
required extras such as `pytest_httpx` and `tomli_w` are available.
Coverage remains at **24%**, far below the **90%** target, the TestPyPI
upload returns HTTPÂ 403, and release notes and packaging steps are
incomplete.

## Milestone

- 0.1.0a1 (2026-04-15)

## Dependencies

- [document-environment-bootstrap](
  archive/document-environment-bootstrap.md)

- [validate-ranking-algorithms-and-agent-coordination](

## Acceptance Criteria
- `task check` and `task verify` complete on a fresh clone without
  hanging during `mypy`.
- Unit tests install required extras (`pytest_httpx`, `tomli_w`) and pass
  consistently.
- Integration tests run with `redis` available or skip cleanly when absent.
- Behavior suite passes or scenarios are updated.
- Coverage meets the **90%** threshold.
- TestPyPI upload succeeds without authorization errors.
- Release notes and packaging instructions drafted.
- Backlog prioritized for post-alpha milestones.
