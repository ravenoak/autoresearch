# Prepare first alpha release

## Context
The project remains unreleased even though the codebase and documentation are
publicly available. To tag version v0.1.0a1, we need a coordinated effort to
finalize outstanding testing, documentation, and packaging tasks while keeping
workflows dispatch-only.

## Dependencies
- [add-a2a-concurrency-proofs-and-simulations](add-a2a-concurrency-proofs-and-simulations.md)
- [stabilize-api-and-improve-search](stabilize-api-and-improve-search.md)
- [resolve-integration-test-regressions](resolve-integration-test-regressions.md)
- [fix-storage-update-claim-mypy-error](fix-storage-update-claim-mypy-error.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All dependency issues are closed.
- Release notes for v0.1.0a1 are drafted in CHANGELOG.md.
- Git tag v0.1.0a1 is created only after tests pass and documentation is updated.
- Workflows remain manual or dispatch-only.

## Status
Open
