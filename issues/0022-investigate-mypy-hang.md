# Issue 22: Investigate mypy hang during verification

Running `uv run mypy src` appears to hang without producing output even after several minutes. This prevents `task verify` from completing.

## Context
`mypy` is expected to complete as part of the verification workflow, but current runs stall indefinitely. The cause may be configuration or dependency related.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Determine why `mypy` does not complete.
- Ensure `uv run mypy src` finishes successfully.
- Document any configuration changes needed.

## Status
Closed â€“ Added `no_site_packages` and disabled `import-untyped` errors in
`pyproject.toml`, preventing mypy from traversing third-party packages.
`uv run mypy src` now completes in around seven seconds without errors.

This resolves the hang observed during verification.
