As of **2025-10-04 at 21:04 UTC** strict typing remains green while the unit
suite exposes ten regressions concentrated in search, cache determinism,
orchestrator telemetry, reasoning answers, and output formatting. `uv run mypy
--strict src tests` continues to report “Success: no issues found in 790 source
files”, yet `uv run --extra test pytest` now fails with search stubs that miss
their mocks, cache lookups that re-hit the backend, non-deterministic
orchestrator merges, warning banners injected into answers, and formatter edge
cases uncovered by Hypothesis.【a78415†L1-L2】【53776f†L1-L60】 Targeted property
and unit tests confirm the concrete behaviours we must address in the upcoming
PR slices: OutputFormatter drops control characters and collapses whitespace,
cache calls ignore persisted entries, and reasoning telemetry prepends warning
strings to answers.【5f96a8†L12-L36】【e865e9†L1-L58】【cf191d†L27-L46】 The revised
preflight plan now sequences PR-S1 through PR-P1 to resolve these failures
before rerunning the full release sweep.
【F:docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md†L38-L115】

As of **2025-10-04 at 05:34 UTC** the strict gate remains green: `uv run mypy
--strict src tests` reported "Success: no issues found in 790 source files",
so we can focus on shrinking the failing pytest surface before rerunning the
full verify sweep.【c2f747†L1-L2】 At **05:31 UTC** `uv run --extra test
pytest` reaches the search stub regression immediately; the legacy and VSS
paths both miss the expected `add_calls` telemetry and the fallback query text
still reflects the templated prompt, confirming PR-C must repair backend
instrumentation before other failures can be measured.【81b49d†L25-L155】
【81b49d†L156-L204】

As of **2025-10-04 at 14:44 UTC** the verify gate remains red, but the
lint sweep has landed: `uv run task verify EXTRAS="nlp ui vss git
distributed analysis llm parsers"` now prints `[verify][lint] flake8
passed`, strict mypy completes, and both legacy and VSS parameterisations
of `tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend`
pass. The run instead stops when
`tests/unit/test_failure_scenarios.py::test_external_lookup_fallback`
observes an empty placeholder URL, confirming PR-C’s instrumentation fix
and isolating the remaining fallback regression.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251004T144057Z.log†L167-L169】【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20251004T144057Z.log†L555-L782】
The paired coverage sweep at **14:45 UTC** fails on the identical
assertion, so coverage evidence still points to the prior 92.4 % run
until the deterministic URL fix lands.【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251004T144436Z.log†L481-L600】
The release plan and alpha ticket cite the new logs and keep TestPyPI on
hold until the fallback regression clears.
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L1-L69】【F:issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md†L1-L39】

As of **2025-10-03 at 22:37 UTC** the strict typing gate is still green and
the pytest suite remains red. `uv run mypy --strict src tests` reported
“Success: no issues found in 787 source files”, confirming the strict
baseline remains stable, while `uv run --extra test pytest` finished with 26
failures and five errors across FactChecker defaults, backup scheduling,
search cache determinism, FastMCP adapters, orchestrator error handling,
planner metadata, storage contracts, and environment metadata checks.
【d70b9a†L1-L2】【ce87c2†L81-L116】

The refreshed [v0.1.0a1 preflight readiness plan](docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md)
now breaks the regression clusters into PR-A through PR-H with dialectical
assessments, then sequences telemetry and planner enhancements as PR-I
through PR-K once the suite is green.
【F:docs/v0.1.0a1_preflight_plan.md†L1-L323】

As of **2025-10-03** the deterministic storage resident-floor documentation is
published at `docs/storage_resident_floor.md`, closing the alpha checklist note
about the two-node floor while the TestPyPI stage stays paused by default.
【F:docs/storage_resident_floor.md†L1-L23】【F:docs/release_plan.md†L324-L356】

PR5 reverification updates now extract stored claims, retry audits with
structured attempt metadata, and persist outcomes via
`StorageManager.persist_claim`. Behavior coverage confirms audit badges remain
visible in response payloads, so the verification backlog centers on coverage
debt rather than missing instrumentation.
【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/reverify.py†L73-L197】
【F:tests/unit/orchestration/test_reverify.py†L1-L80】
【F:tests/behavior/features/reasoning_modes.feature†L8-L22】

PR4 retrieval enhancements export GraphML and JSON artifacts with contradiction
signals wired into `SearchContext` and `QueryState`, and unit tests lock the
serialization path so downstream tools can rely on the new metadata.
【F:src/autoresearch/knowledge/graph.py†L113-L204】

【F:src/autoresearch/orchestration/state.py†L1120-L1135】
【F:tests/unit/storage/test_knowledge_graph.py†L1-L63】

As of **2025-10-03** at 01:32 UTC
`uv run task verify EXTRAS="nlp ui vss git distributed analysis llm parsers"`
still fails in the flake8 phase because behavior, integration, and storage
tests retain unused imports, blank-line debt, and undefined helper references.
The accompanying coverage sweep at 01:34 UTC stops when
`test_scheduler_restarts_existing_timer` observes that its dummy timer never
marks itself as cancelled, so `coverage.xml` remains unchanged while the
regression stands.

【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251003T013422Z.log†L1-L40】

As of **2025-09-30** at 18:19 UTC `uv run task coverage` finishes with the
92.4 % statement rate after the QueryState registry clone switched to typed
deep copies that rehydrate locks. The regression suite now covers register,
update, and round-trip flows, preventing `_thread.RLock` sharing across
snapshots while the TestPyPI directive remains on hold.

# Autoresearch Project - Task Progress

As of **2025-10-01** at 14:39 UTC the repo-wide `uv run mypy --strict src tests`
sweep surfaces 2,114 errors across 211 files, concentrating the remaining strict
backlog inside analysis, integration, and behavior fixtures. The log confirms
strict mode now runs end-to-end with the new stubs, so the next milestone is
threading the widened `EvaluationSummary` signature through those fixtures.
【F:baseline/logs/mypy-strict-20251001T143959Z.log†L2358-L2377】

As of **2025-10-02** follow-up planner coordination resumes behind the green
strict gate while coverage continues to track the September 30 evidence until a
fresh sweep lands.
【F:baseline/logs/mypy-strict-20251002T235732Z.log†L1-L1】
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T181947Z.log†L1-L21】

As of **2025-10-01** at 14:40 UTC `uv run task coverage` (with non-GPU extras)
reaches the unit suite before `QueryStateRegistry.register` replays the
`_thread.RLock` cloning error in
`tests/unit/orchestration/test_orchestrator_auto_mode.py::`
`test_auto_mode_escalates_to_debate_when_gate_requires_loops`. The coverage gate
therefore remains at the previously recorded 92.4 % evidence, and the TestPyPI
dry run stays deferred until the registry clone adopts the typed handoff
captured in the strict backlog above.
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251001T144044Z.log†L122-L241】

As of **2025-10-01** at 15:27 UTC the coverage rerun with the same extras clears
the registry cloning path and now fails when FastEmbed stays importable,
causing `test_search_embedding_protocol_falls_back_to_encode` to assert that the
sentence-transformers fallback never activated. The log documents the new
failure mode while coverage remains below the gate and the TestPyPI dry run
continues to wait on a green sweep.
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20251001T152708Z.log†L60-L166】

As of **2025-09-30** at 14:55 UTC the strict `task verify` sweep reaches
`mypy --strict` before stopping on 118 untyped fixtures and the
`EvaluationSummary` constructor, which now expects planner depth and routing
metrics. The regression blocks the strict gate and evaluation coverage until the
tests adopt the expanded signature documented in the log.

【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T145541Z.log†L2606-L2617】

As of **2025-09-30** at 14:28 UTC the final-answer audit documentation now feeds
fresh verification evidence: the `task verify` rerun stops in the known
`QueryState.model_copy` strict typing gap after registering the new `audit.*`
policy toggles, and the 14:30 UTC `task coverage` sweep (base extras only)
fails in the `A2AMessage` schema regression. These logs anchor the audit-loop
update while the TestPyPI directive stays deferred.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T142820Z.log†L1-L36】
【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T143024Z.log†L1-L41】

As of **2025-09-30** at 19:04 UTC `task release:alpha` runs end-to-end through
linting, typing, verification, coverage, packaging, and the TestPyPI dry run.
The verify and coverage stages archive the recalibrated scout gate telemetry,
CLI path helper checks, and 92.4 % statement rate, while the packaging step
records fresh 0.1.0a1 artifacts. `prepare-first-alpha-release` now cites the
three logs so release reviewers can audit the evidence trail.
【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T174512Z.log†L1-L23】【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T181947Z.log†L1-L21】

XPASS cleanup is complete and the Phase 1 deep research objectives are now
green; the release plan archives the XPASS, heuristics proof, and packaging
tickets alongside the Phase 1 completion note in the deep research plan.
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L214-L236】【F:docs/deep_research_upgrade_plan.md†L19-L36】

The remaining alpha checklist items focus on lifting the TestPyPI dry-run hold
and scheduling the release sign-off meeting once the publish directive changes.
Track progress via the open checkbox in `docs/release_plan.md` and the updated
alpha ticket.

Strict type coverage now includes the Streamlit UI stack thanks to freshly
curated stubs for Streamlit, pandas, polars, matplotlib, PIL, altair, and
rank_bm25. The new coverage unblocks `mypy --strict` on the UI modules and adds
integration coverage for the modal fallback when Streamlit lacks native modal
support.
【F:docs/release_plan.md†L200-L209】【F:issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md†L36-L57】

As of **2025-09-29** at 17:36 UTC the new `task verify` sweep clears linting but
still reports 93 strict typing errors across the HTTP session adapters,
evaluation harness, Streamlit CLI, and distributed executor protocols. The
matching `task coverage` run at 17:37 UTC synced all non-GPU extras and began
the unit suite before we manually interrupted the log while running
`tests/unit/test_additional_coverage.py`
(`test_render_evaluation_summary_joins_artifacts`),
so coverage evidence remains incomplete while the TestPyPI dry run stays on
hold under the release directive.

As of **2025-09-29** at 01:33 UTC the targeted stub backend regression check
(`uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend -vv`)
passes for both legacy and DuckDB VSS parameterizations, confirming the
four-call profile across lookup phases while we captured the release sweep
success above.

As of **2025-09-29** at 00:08 UTC we reran `uv run task release:alpha` after
closing out the deep research phase tracking below. Extras synced before
`uv run flake8 src tests` reported the unused `os` import in
`tests/integration/test_streamlit_gui.py`, so the sweep stopped before verify,
coverage, packaging, or TestPyPI. The log at
`baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250929T000814Z.log` and its summary document the
intentional TestPyPI deferral under the current directive.【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250929T000814Z.log†L1-L41】【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250929T000814Z.summary.md†L1-L12】

As of **2025-09-30** at 18:19 UTC direct `task verify` and `task coverage`
invocations succeed from the Task CLI again. The 17:45 UTC verification sweep
exercised linting, typing, and the full unit, integration, and behavior matrix
while streaming the VSS loader and scout gate telemetry, and the 18:19 UTC
coverage follow-up held the ≥90 % gate with a CLI remediation banner in the log.
The new evidence lives at
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T174512Z.log` and
`baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T181947Z.log`, confirming the CLI and VSS
regressions are resolved before the release sweep resumes.【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250930T174512Z.log†L1-L23】【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250930T181947Z.log†L1-L21】

As of **2025-09-28** at 16:17 UTC the first strict-typing `uv run task verify`
run completes flake8 and fails in mypy, which surfaces missing stubs and 230
strict errors across storage, orchestration, and API modules. The strict gate
remains red while we triage the baseline captured in
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T161734Z.log`.【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T161734Z.log†L1-L46】【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T161734Z.log†L47-L120】

As of **2025-09-28** at 03:10 UTC `scripts/codex_setup.sh` ensures Go Task
installs into `.venv/bin`, Taskfile once again exposes the `verify` and
`coverage` targets, and fresh sweeps reach the substantive failures instead of
exiting early. `uv run task verify` now stops in `flake8`, which reports the
pre-existing style violations across orchestration, storage, and benchmark
modules, while `uv run task coverage` completes the extras sync and fails in
`tests/unit/orchestration/test_gate_policy.py::test_scout_gate_reduces_loops_when_signals_low`
after the scout gate keeps the debate loop enabled. The new logs,
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T031021Z.log` and
`baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250928T031031Z.log`, capture the upgraded
pipeline progression.【F:scripts/codex_setup.sh†L1-L66】【F:Taskfile.yml†L1-L136】【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T031021Z.log†L1-L68】【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250928T031031Z.log†L1-L120】【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250928T031031Z.log†L200-L280】

As of **2025-09-28** at 01:10 UTC fresh `uv run task verify` and
`uv run task coverage` attempts immediately exit because the Go Task CLI only
lists the eight bootstrap targets (`behavior`, `check`, `check-env`,
`check-release-metadata`, `install`, `integration`, `lint-specs`, and `unit`).
The new logs capture the failure banner so we can revisit the Taskfile layout
after landing the CLI formatter fix:
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T011001Z.log` and
`baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250928T011012Z.log` record the missing-task
errors.【F:baseline/logs/task-verify-20250928T011001Z.log†L1-L13】【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250928T011012Z.log†L1-L13】

As of **2025-09-27** at 04:38 UTC we reran `uv run task coverage`; `baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250927T043839Z.log` captures the extras sync, coverage reset, and the unit suite collecting 76 cases before Pytest aborts on the unterminated string literal in `src/autoresearch/cli_utils.py` surfaced through `tests/unit/test_additional_coverage.py`, so the coverage gate still hinges on patching that CLI formatter. 【F:baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250927T043839Z.log†L200-L228】

As of **2025-09-26** we delivered the curated truthfulness harness: `uv run autoresearch evaluate run <suite>` now drives the TruthfulQA, FEVER, and HotpotQA subsets, stores metrics in DuckDB and Parquet under `baseline/evaluation/`, and tags each run with a config signature so we can correlate telemetry. This unblocks [build-truthfulness-evaluation-harness](issues/build-truthfulness-evaluation-harness.md) and documents the licensing and interpretation guidance called out in the status docs.

As of **2025-09-27** the Deep Research execution plan is captured in
`docs/deep_research_upgrade_plan.md`, the roadmap, and the five new issues
covering adaptive gating, planner upgrades, session GraphRAG, evaluation, and
cost-aware routing. These tickets extend the alpha workstream without altering
existing coverage targets.

This document tracks the progress of tasks for the Autoresearch project,
organized by phases from the code complete plan. As of **2025-09-25** at
00:15 UTC we reran `uv run task verify`, `uv run task coverage`,
`uv run --extra docs mkdocs build`, and `uv run --extra build python -m build`
through the `uv` wrappers in fresh shells. `task verify` now halts in
`tests/unit/test_eviction.py::test_lru_eviction_sequence` because the LRU
policy removes both `c1` and `c2`, but the log shows
`test_search_stub_backend[legacy]`, `[vss-enabled]`, and the
`return_handles` fallback succeeding before the eviction failure, confirming the
stub fix while we track the regression in
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250925T000904Z.log` and
[investigate-lru-eviction-regression](issues/investigate-lru-eviction-regression.md).
`task coverage` fails earlier when Ray cannot serialize `QueryState`, so the run
ends at `tests/unit/test_distributed_executors.py::test_execute_agent_remote`
with details recorded in `baseline/logs/task-coverage-20250925T001017Z.log` and
the follow-up ticket
[address-ray-serialization-regression](issues/address-ray-serialization-regression.md).
MkDocs and packaging both completed; their logs are archived at
`baseline/logs/mkdocs-build-20250925T001535Z.log` and
`baseline/logs/python-build-20250925T001554Z.log` while we work through the open
verify and coverage failures.

All GitHub workflows remain dispatch-only, so the verification reruns continue
to execute manually through these `uv run` wrappers until the alpha gate is
cleared and the Actions jobs are retriggered.
【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L8】
As of **2025-09-24** at
23:30 UTC we repeated the stub backend sanity check and the full
`release:alpha` sweep. The targeted invocation
`uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit/test_core_modules_additional.py::test_search_stub_backend -vv`
completed in 1.78 s, reconfirming the fixture still passes in isolation before
the broader automation runs.【F:baseline/logs/targeted-test-search-stub-backend-20250924T233042Z.log†L1-L17】
Running `uv run task release:alpha` at 23:30:58Z resynchronized every dev,
test, analysis, and distribution extra, but the unit coverage phase failed when
`test_search_stub_backend` observed four `embedding_calls` after the DuckDB VSS
extras enabled vector search while the test still asserts only two calls. The
log also shows the vector store emitting a transient "Failed to create HNSW
index" error while enabling experimental persistence; the sweep continued past
that warning but halted on the assertion mismatch, leaving packaging and
publish steps unexecuted.【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T233058Z.log†L1-L142】【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T233058Z.log†L488-L585】

As of **2025-09-24** the PR 1 release sweep captured `baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T183041Z.log`,
`baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T184646Z.log`, and
`baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T184646Z.summary.md`. The run executed 243
checks (240 passed, two skipped) before `test_search_stub_backend` raised a
TypeError, so packaging and publish steps remain blocked until the stub accepts
the additional embedding handle parameter documented in the summary and release
plan. Fresh shells still report `task --version` as missing, keeping the PATH
helper in play for future sweeps.【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T183041Z.log†L20-L40】【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T184646Z.summary.md†L1-L5】【F:baseline/logs/release-alpha-20250924T184646Z.log†L448-L485】【3c283b†L21-L33】【0d0c77†L1-L3】

[issues/archive/stabilize-storage-eviction-property.md]. Integration and
behavior suites pass with optional extras skipped, and `uv run --extra docs
mkdocs build` completes without warnings after prior documentation fixes.
September 24 planning added
[refresh-token-budget-monotonicity-proof](issues/archive/refresh-token-budget-monotonicity-proof.md)
and
[stage-0-1-0a1-release-artifacts](issues/archive/stage-0-1-0a1-release-artifacts.md)
as dependencies of
[prepare-first-alpha-release](issues/prepare-first-alpha-release.md) so the
XPASS promotions, heuristics proof, and packaging dry runs land before tagging.

On September 24, 2025 we refreshed the lint, type, spec lint, documentation, and
packaging gates with the current Python 3.12.10 / `uv 0.7.22` toolchain.
`uv run --extra dev-minimal --extra test flake8 src tests`, `uv run --extra
dev-minimal --extra test mypy src`, `uv run python scripts/lint_specs.py`, and
`uv run --extra docs mkdocs build` all succeeded, and `uv run --extra build
python -m build` plus `uv run scripts/publish_dev.py --dry-run --repository
testpypi` produced the staged logs
`baseline/logs/build-20250924T172531Z.log` and
`baseline/logs/publish-dev-20250924T172554Z.log`, with hashes recorded in the
release plan prerequisites section.【5bf964†L1-L2】【4db948†L1-L3】【6e0aba†L1-L2】【375bbd†L1-L4】【7349f6†L1-L1】【b4608b†L1-L3】【1cbd7f†L1-L3】【F:baseline/logs/build-20250924T172531Z.log†L1-L13】【F:baseline/logs/publish-dev-20250924T172554Z.log†L1-L14】【F:docs/release_plan.md†L95-L120】
The first warnings-as-errors `task verify` attempt, captured in
`baseline/logs/task-verify-20250923T204706Z.log`, stopped at
`tests/targeted/test_extras_codepaths.py:13:5: F401 'sys' imported but unused`.
Removing that fallback import enabled the rerun to execute under
`PYTHONWARNINGS=error::DeprecationWarning`, finishing 890 unit, 324
integration, and 29 behavior tests with full coverage and no resource tracker
messages in `baseline/logs/task-verify-20250923T204732Z.log` before archiving
[issues/archive/resolve-resource-tracker-errors-in-verify.md].

The monitor and extensions specs continue to present the required
`## Simulation Expectations` sections, keeping spec lint green.
【F:docs/specs/monitor.md†L126-L165】【F:docs/specs/extensions.md†L1-L69】 Storage
regressions remain resolved: `uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit -k
"storage" -q --maxfail=1` still reports 136 passed, 2 skipped, 822 deselected,
and 1 xfailed tests, and `baseline/coverage.xml` preserves a line-rate of 1 for
the targeted suites. 【714199†L1-L2】【F:baseline/coverage.xml†L1-L12】
Documentation builds now publish the GPU wheel cache instructions inside
`docs/wheels/gpu.md`, and the navigation links the new page so the MkDocs
warning cleared. `uv run --extra docs mkdocs build` now completes without
missing-target warnings after the release plan references the open tickets by
slug, so fix-release-plan-issue-links is archived alongside the resource
tracker, warnings sweep, and coverage refresh tasks that remain open.

As of **2025-09-24** we revalidated the fast gates with the Codex
toolchain: `uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit -m "not slow" -rxX` returned
890 passes, 33 skips, eight expected failures, and five xpass promotions,
mirroring the outstanding tickets covering ranking, search, metrics, and
storage. Linting (`flake8`), typing (`mypy`), MkDocs, and the refreshed
packaging logs also succeeded under `uv`, keeping the alpha track focused on
the listed issue dependencies.【5b78c5†L1-L71】【5bf964†L1-L2】【4db948†L1-L3】【375bbd†L1-L4】【7349f6†L1-L1】【b4608b†L1-L3】【1cbd7f†L1-L3】【F:baseline/logs/build-20250924T172531Z.log†L1-L13】【F:baseline/logs/publish-dev-20250924T172554Z.log†L1-L14】
