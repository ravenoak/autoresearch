# Autoresearch Project - Task Progress

This document tracks the progress of tasks for the Autoresearch project,
organized by phases from the code complete plan. As of **September 17, 2025**
the evaluation container still lacks the Go Task CLI by default, so
`uv run task check` fails until `scripts/setup.sh` installs the binary.
Running `uv sync --extra dev-minimal --extra test` followed by
`uv run python scripts/check_env.py` leaves only the missing Go Task warning in
this environment. 【12a21c†L1-L9】【0525bf†L1-L26】 Targeted unit tests confirm
that the config validator, DuckDB offline fallback, and VSS extension loader
all pass with the `[test]` extras installed. 【4567c0†L1-L2】【3108ac†L1-L2】
【abaaf2†L1-L2】 Integration scenarios for ranking consistency and optional extras
also succeed with the `[test]` extras installed. 【897640†L1-L3】【d26393†L1-L2】
However, `uv run --extra test pytest tests/unit -q` still aborts during
collection because `scripts/distributed_coordination_sim.py` no longer exports
`elect_leader` or `process_messages`, so the distributed property tests cannot
import their reference helpers. 【382418†L1-L23】 `uv run mkdocs build` still fails
until the docs extras sync `mkdocs` onto the PATH. 【9f25fa†L1-L3】 Unit coverage and `task verify` remain blocked while the
Task CLI is missing and the distributed regression persists.
See [docs/release_plan.md](docs/release_plan.md) for current test and coverage
status and the alpha release checklist. An **0.1.0-alpha.1** preview remains
targeted for **September 15, 2026**, with the final **0.1.0** release targeted
for **October 1, 2026**.

Running a focused subset of tests with coverage produced **32%** line coverage
across targeted modules. Full `task coverage` was attempted but could not
complete in this environment.

### Latest Test Results

Full suite attempts:

```
./.venv/bin/task check
```

Result: 8 passed in ~1s

```
./.venv/bin/task verify
```

Result: `tests/unit/test_api_auth_middleware.py::test_resolve_role_missing_key` failed.

### Performance Baselines

Current benchmark metrics for a single dummy query:

- Duration: ~0.003s
- Memory delta: ~0 MB
- Tokens: {"Dummy": {"in": 2, "out": 7}}
- Regenerated API docs and verified architecture diagrams against current code.


### Phase 1 Review

Storage and search features remain under active development as tests reveal
failing scenarios. Further work is required to meet the CODE_COMPLETE_PLAN Phase
1 goals.
