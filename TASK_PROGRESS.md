# Autoresearch Project - Task Progress

This document tracks the progress of tasks for the Autoresearch project,
organized by phases from the code complete plan. As of **August 16, 2025**, `pytest`
aborts before collecting tests (`ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi`), so coverage is
unavailable. Issue [unit tests after orchestrator refactor](issues/unit-tests-after-orchestrator-refactor.md)
lists **13 failing unit tests**, and issue
[refactor orchestrator to instance-level circuit breaker](issues/archive/refactor-orchestrator-instance-circuit-breaker.md) documents the underlying
refactor. The **0.1.0** release is now targeted for **March 1, 2026**.

### Coverage Report

Coverage could not be generated because `pytest` fails to import `fastapi`
(see [unit tests after orchestrator refactor](issues/unit-tests-after-orchestrator-refactor.md)).

### Latest Test Results

- `pytest --cov=src` aborts with `ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi`.
  See [unit tests after orchestrator refactor](issues/unit-tests-after-orchestrator-refactor.md) for the
  failing test list.
- `uv run flake8 src tests` reports no style errors.
- `uv run mypy src` fails to load `pydantic.mypy` (`No module named 'pydantic'`).

### Performance Baselines

Current benchmark metrics for a single dummy query:

- Duration: ~0.003s
- Memory delta: ~0 MB
- Tokens: {"Dummy": {"in": 2, "out": 7}}
- Regenerated API docs and verified architecture diagrams against current code.


### Phase 1 Review

All orchestrator, specialized agent, search, and storage features match the CODE_COMPLETE_PLAN Phase 1 goals. No discrepancies were found during review.
