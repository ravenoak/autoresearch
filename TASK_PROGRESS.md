### Coverage Report

The latest `uv run pytest --cov=src` run on 2025-08-09 failed due to an
`AssertionError` in `tests/unit/test_api.py::test_request_log_thread_safety`.
Coverage metrics were not generated and remain below the **90%** goal.

### Latest Test Results

- `flake8` reports no style errors.
- `mypy` reports no type issues.
- `pytest` fails in `tests/unit/test_api.py::test_request_log_thread_safety`
  (`AssertionError: assert None == 20`).

### Performance Baselines

Current benchmark metrics for a single dummy query:

- Duration: ~0.003s
- Memory delta: ~0 MB
- Tokens: {"Dummy": {"in": 2, "out": 7}}
- Regenerated API docs and verified architecture diagrams against current code.


### Phase 1 Review

All orchestrator, specialized agent, search, and storage features match the CODE_COMPLETE_PLAN Phase 1 goals. No discrepancies were found during review.
