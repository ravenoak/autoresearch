The latest `task coverage` run on 2025-07-29 did not complete successfully due
to a `ConfigError` raised during configuration loading. Coverage metrics could
not be generated.

### Latest Test Results

- `flake8` reports no style errors.
- `mypy` completes without type issues.
- `pytest` fails due to a configuration validation error (ConfigError).

### Performance Baselines

Current benchmark metrics for a single dummy query:

- Duration: ~0.003s
- Memory delta: ~0 MB
- Tokens: {"Dummy": {"in": 2, "out": 7}}
- Regenerated API docs and verified architecture diagrams against current code.
